Let's look at three specific moments where this creates the reading magic. First: the Boo Radley scene where child-Scout feels 'someone's watching' but adult-Scout reveals 'he was protecting us all along.' Notice what's happening here - we get the child's authentic fear AND the adult's moral understanding. This is bidirectional unreliability in action. The child consciousness understands too little about Boo's motivations, while the adult consciousness reveals too much about the outcome. Second example...",

      "final_content": "How Does Scout's Narration Work in To Kill a Mockingbird?\n\nScout's narration creates a unique dual consciousness that makes To Kill a Mockingbird so compelling. As both child experiencing events and adult remembering them, Scout operates through what we call retrospective filtering - her adult moral understanding processes childhood memories while preserving the child's authentic voice. This creates systematic tension: Scout-the-child understands too little about racial injustice, while Scout-the-adult reveals too much about coming tragedy. The result is bidirectional unreliability that puts readers in the same position as the child narrator - we feel her confusion while sensing deeper adult truths...",
