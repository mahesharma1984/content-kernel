  "selection_rationale": "This thread scored highest (37/40) because it perfectly balances all four criteria. It's maximally memorable with 'Scout Paradox' and the concrete 'knows too much and too little' formulation. It's highly differentiating by positioning Scout as rule-breaking rather than flawed. It's completely pattern-anchored - the paradox IS the Maturing Moral Witness pattern's core dynamic. And it has perfect funnel continuity: the hook is the mysterious paradox, the solution is how retrospective narration creates this effect systematically. The 'paradox' framing works equally well as a social media tease ('Everyone knows Scout is unreliable in OPPOSITE directions') and as a comprehensive guide framework ('How the Maturing Moral Witness Pattern Creates Systematic Bidirectional Unreliability').",
  "kernel_pattern_reference": "The paradox IS the core dynamic: 'First-person retrospective narration filters adult moral understanding through remembered childhood innocence, creating dramatic irony between child-Scout's limited comprehension and adult-Scout's ethical clarity'",
