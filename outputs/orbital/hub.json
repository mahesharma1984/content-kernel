      "description": "The narrator has omniscient access to multiple consciousness flows.\n\nThis means we can see inside different characters' minds — their thoughts, feelings, inner experiences.\n\nBut the narrator also maintains an objective philosophical stance.\n\nThey step back from the individual emotions to observe the bigger picture.\n\nThese two techniques combine to create something specific:\n• A meditative observation of human experience\n• Set against cosmic scale\n\nAsk yourself: Why does Harvey give us both intimate access to thoughts AND distant philosophical perspective?\n\nThe effect is contemplative — we feel close to the characters while simultaneously seeing how small human concerns appear against the vastness of space.",
      "reader_effect": "Readers experience two perspectives at the same time:\n\n• **Intimacy**: we're close to individual human thoughts\n• **Detachment**: we see from a vast, cosmic perspective\n\nThis creates contemplative distance.\n\nWhat is contemplative distance? It means we can think deeply about what we're observing rather than just feeling it.\n\nThe technique works like this:\n• Close perspective → we connect emotionally\n• Distant perspective → we step back and analyse\n• Together → we both feel AND think\n\nAsk yourself: Why does this distance matter?\n\nThe dual perspective elevates mundane experience to universal significance.\n\nLet's unpack this complex idea:\n• \"Mundane experience\" = ordinary, everyday moments\n• \"Universal significance\" = truths about all of humanity\n• \"Elevates\" = lifts something up, makes it more important\n\nThe process works like this:\nOne person's ordinary moment → becomes a symbol → represents something true for everyone.\n\nThis is how literature transforms the specific into the universal — individual experience becomes a mirror for human nature itself.",
