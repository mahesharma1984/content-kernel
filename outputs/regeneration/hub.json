      "description": "The narrative uses third-person limited point of view.\n\nBut it's filtered specifically through a medical perspective — we see events through the lens of clinical understanding.\n\nThis combines two approaches:\n• Objective stance: clinical, factual observations\n• Compassionate stance: empathetic, caring tone\n\nThe result is therapeutic distance.\n\nAsk yourself: Why would an author want this kind of distance?\n\nThe medical filter creates enough emotional space between reader and trauma — we're not overwhelmed by raw pain.\n\nThis distance paradoxically enables deeper understanding.\n\nWhen we're not drowning in emotion, we can examine the trauma more clearly and comprehensively.",
      "reader_effect": "Readers experience psychological wounds in two distinct ways:\n• Clinical observation — watching from the outside, like a doctor studying symptoms\n• Intimate consciousness — feeling from the inside, sharing the character's inner world\n\nThis dual perspective creates a powerful combination:\n• Intellectual comprehension — we understand what is happening and why\n• Emotional resonance — we feel the impact on a personal level\n\nAsk yourself: Why does the author give us both viewpoints? \n\nThe pairing means we don't just analyze the psychological damage — we also experience its emotional weight.",

The pairing means readers don't just analyse the psychological damage — they experience it viscerally while maintaining enough distance to reflect on its meaning."
