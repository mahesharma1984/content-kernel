          "structure_notes": "This analysis works in three stages:\n\n**Stage 1: Identifies the technique**\n• Pinpoints exactly which literary device the writer uses\n• Names the specific tool (metaphor, juxtaposition, symbolism, etc.)\n\n**Stage 2: Explains the transformation process**\n• Shows how the device actually works in the text\n• Reveals the mechanism — how does this technique change meaning?\n• Traces the journey from literal words to deeper significance\n\n**Stage 3: Connects to trauma processing**\n• States why this transformation matters for understanding trauma\n• Explains how the literary technique helps readers process difficult experiences\n• Makes the link between form and psychological impact explicit\n\nAsk yourself: How does identifying the specific device help us understand the writer's method for exploring trauma?"

          "focus": "Theme-focused",
          "statement": "Barker examines War's Inescapable Psychological Legacy through imagery and metaphor, revealing that clinical observation exposes trauma not as a temporary condition to be cured but as a permanent alteration of consciousness that becomes integral to identity.",
          "structure_notes": "Theme-focused writing does three things:\n\n• It centers on a specific theme (trauma's lasting impact)\n• It shows how literary devices reveal that trauma is permanent\n• It challenges what readers might assume — that trauma can be fixed or \"cured\"\n\nAsk yourself: What assumption is being challenged here?\n\nThe assumption that trauma has an endpoint. That healing means forgetting.\n\nThe literary devices work together to reveal a harder truth — trauma becomes part of who someone is, permanently woven into their identity."
