You are refining content to meet channel constraints.

Your task is Stage 5B of KDD: Constrained Content Refinement.

CORE THREAD (the message that unifies all channels):
---
Message: {core_message}
Agitation Register: {agitation_register}
Solution Register: {solution_register}
---

STARTING DRAFTS (from winning angle in Phase 1):
---
{starting_drafts_json}
---

CHANNEL STRATEGY (from Stage 2):
---
{channel_strategy_json}
---

YOUR TASK:

For each channel, revise the starting draft to meet ALL constraints while preserving the core thread.

## REVISION CHECKLIST

For each channel, check:

1. **Job Check**: Does this do the ONE job defined for this channel?
2. **Must Do Check**: Does it meet every "must do" requirement?
3. **Must Not Do Check**: Does it avoid every "must not do"?
4. **Thread Check**: Is the core message recognizable?
5. **Register Check**: Is it using the right register (agitation or solution)?

## SOCIAL

Starting draft: {social_draft}

Job: {social_job}
Must Do: {social_must_do}
Must Not Do: {social_must_not_do}
Register: Should use AGITATION (tease problem, point to solution)

Revise and provide:
- Final video script (60-90 seconds, with [HOOK], [VISUAL], [SPOKEN], [CLIFFHANGER], [CTA] markers)
- What you changed and why
- Constraint validation (pass/fail each item)

## YOUTUBE

Starting draft: {youtube_draft}

Job: {youtube_job}
Must Do: {youtube_must_do}
Must Not Do: {youtube_must_not_do}
Register: Should use SOLUTION (demonstrate the pattern working)

Revise and provide:
- Final opening script (60-90 seconds)
- What you changed and why
- Constraint validation

## SEO

Starting draft: {seo_draft}

Job: {seo_job}
Must Do: {seo_must_do}
Must Not Do: {seo_must_not_do}
Register: Should use SOLUTION (answer search intent with pattern preview)

Revise and provide:
- Final headline + opening paragraph
- What you changed and why
- Constraint validation

## GUIDE

Starting draft: {guide_draft}

Job: {guide_job}
Must Do: {guide_must_do}
Must Not Do: {guide_must_not_do}
Register: Should use SOLUTION (full pattern delivery)

Revise and provide:
- Final title + introduction + structure
- What you changed and why
- Constraint validation

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Return your refined content using this exact markdown structure:

**Introduction:**

**Structure:**

2. ...

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Be honest about validation**: If something fails a constraint, say so
2. **Preserve kernel references**: Don't lose the connection to source material
3. **Minimum viable changes**: Don't over-revise what already works
4. **Thread must be visible**: The core message should be recognizable in every channel
