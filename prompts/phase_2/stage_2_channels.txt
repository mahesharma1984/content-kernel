You are defining channel strategy for content distribution.

Your task is to apply Stage 2 of the Kernel-Derived Distribution (KDD) methodology: Channel Strategy.

CORE THREAD (SELECTED IN STAGE 4):
---
{core_message}

AGITATION REGISTER: {agitation_register}
SOLUTION REGISTER: {solution_register}

PATTERN REFERENCE: {kernel_pattern_reference}
---

THE CONSTRAINT PRINCIPLE:

Channel jobs DERIVE from the thread, not imposed beforehand.

Given the selected core thread, each channel must:
1. Have ONE specific job in the funnel
2. Use the thread (agitation or solution register)
3. Be different from other channels
4. Serve a stage in the awareness journey

THE FUNNEL FLOW:

Social → YouTube → SEO → Guide

Each channel moves the user closer to full pattern understanding.

YOUR TASK:

For each channel, define:

**SOCIAL (Twitter/Instagram)**
- Typical format: 280 characters, image/thread
- User awareness stage: Problem-aware to Solution-aware
- Typical search intent: N/A (discovery, not search)

Questions to answer:
1. What's this channel's ONE job? (1 sentence)
2. Which register does it use? (agitation or solution)
3. What MUST it do? (2-3 required elements)
4. What MUST it NOT do? (2-3 constraints)
5. How does it use the thread?
6. Success metric: How do we know it worked?
7. Failure mode: What would break this job?

**YOUTUBE (5-10 min videos)**
- Typical format: Video with script, examples
- User awareness stage: Solution-aware to Product-aware
- Typical search intent: "how to analyze TKAM", "TKAM literary devices explained"

[Same questions as Social]

**SEO (Landing pages)**
- Typical format: 800-1200 word article
- User awareness stage: Problem-aware to Solution-aware
- Typical search intent: High-intent questions (see Stage 1)

[Same questions as Social]

**GUIDE (PDF download)**
- Typical format: 10-20 page structured document
- User awareness stage: Product-aware to Most-aware
- Typical search intent: N/A (arrives via funnel)

[Same questions as Social]

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:

- Each channel gets ONE job only (not multiple goals)
- Jobs must be DIFFERENT (no redundancy)
- Jobs must use the THREAD explicitly
- Jobs must serve the FUNNEL (no random channels)

EXAMPLE (NOT for TKAM, just illustration):

Social job: "Agitate the problem using thread's hook form. Tease pattern without revealing. CTA to video."
YouTube job: "Demonstrate the pattern with 2-3 examples. Show method working. CTA to guide."
SEO job: "Answer search intent using thread's solution form. Partial pattern delivery. CTA to guide."
Guide job: "Deliver full pattern + all devices + application method. No CTA needed."

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{{
  "Social": {{
    "job": "One sentence job description",
    "register": "agitation",
    "must_do": ["requirement 1", "requirement 2"],
    "must_not_do": ["constraint 1", "constraint 2"],
    "thread_usage": "How this channel uses the core thread",
    "success_metric": "What indicates success",
    "failure_mode": "What would break this"
  }},
  "YouTube": {{ ... }},
  "SEO": {{ ... }},
  "Guide": {{ ... }}
}}
