You are evaluating message angles to select a core thread for content strategy.

Your task is to apply Stage 4 of the Kernel-Derived Distribution (KDD) methodology: Thread Selection.

CONTEXT:

From Stage 3, we generated {num_angles} message angles across 4 channels. Now we must select the ONE thread that will unify the entire funnel.

MESSAGE MATRIX:
---
{json_of_all_angles}
---

TEXT KERNEL PATTERN:
---
{kernel_pattern}
---

THE 4 SELECTION CRITERIA:

Every angle will be scored 0-10 on each criterion. The highest total score wins.

**1. MEMORABLE (0-10)**
Can a student repeat this to a friend?

Score HIGH (8-10) if:
- Core idea is simple and concrete
- Uses vivid language or clear metaphor
- Sticks in memory after one exposure
- A student could explain it without notes

Score LOW (0-3) if:
- Too abstract or academic
- Jargon-heavy or requires background
- Forgettable or generic phrasing

**2. DIFFERENTIATING (0-10)**
Does it separate us from competitors?

Score HIGH (8-10) if:
- Other TKAM guides don't say this
- Challenges common readings
- Offers unique lens or method
- Makes the guide necessary, not optional

Score LOW (0-3) if:
- Standard literary analysis talk
- Generic "themes and symbols" framing
- Could appear in any study guide
- Doesn't require this specific kernel

**3. PATTERN-ANCHORED (0-10)**
Does understanding this require understanding the kernel's pattern?

Score HIGH (8-10) if:
- The message IS the pattern, not about the pattern
- Can't understand the message without seeing the pattern
- Message leads directly to pattern insight
- Pattern is the "why" behind the message

Score LOW (0-3) if:
- Message stands alone without pattern
- Pattern is optional context
- Generic claim that doesn't need this pattern
- Message could work with any TKAM analysis

**4. FUNNEL-CONTINUOUS (0-10)**
Can this stretch from agitation (social tease) to delivery (full guide)?

Score HIGH (8-10) if:
- Has clear "agitation register" (hook form)
- Has clear "solution register" (explanation form)
- Same thread works across all channels
- Creates natural progression: tease → demo → answer → deliver

Score LOW (0-3) if:
- Only works in one form (can't scale)
- Hook and explanation feel disconnected
- Would need different threads per channel
- No natural agitation → solution flow

YOUR TASK:

For each of the {num_angles} message angles:

1. Score it against all 4 criteria (0-10 each)
2. Provide brief justification for each score
3. Calculate total score (sum of 4 criteria, max 40)
4. Identify the agitation register (how to use as hook/tease)
5. Identify the solution register (how to use as full explanation)

After scoring all angles, IDENTIFY THE WINNER and explain:
- Why it scored highest
- How it meets all 4 criteria
- What its agitation and solution registers are
- How it will unify the funnel

  }}
}}

CRITICAL: Be honest with scores. Most angles will score 20-30 out of 40. A perfect 40 is nearly impossible. The winner should be clearly better, not arbitrarily chosen.
