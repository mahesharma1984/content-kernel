You are creating exploratory content drafts from message angles.

Your task is Stage 5A of KDD: Generate draft content to test which message angles work as actual content.

MESSAGE ANGLES FROM STAGE 3:
---
{angles_json}
---

TEXT KERNEL (source material):
---
Pattern: {kernel_pattern}
Core Dynamic: {core_dynamic}
Reader Effect: {reader_effect}

Priority Devices:
{device_list_with_effects}

Sample Quotes:
{sample_quotes}
---

YOUR TASK:

Review all the message angles above. For EACH CHANNEL (not each angle), select the 2-3 most promising angles and generate draft variations for those.

SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Which angles best embody the kernel's pattern?
- Which angles are most differentiated from each other?
- Which angles would produce compelling content?

You should end up with 8-12 total drafts (2-3 angles per channel × 4 channels).

FOR EACH SELECTED ANGLE, PRODUCE:

## Social (select 2-3 angles from Social angles)
- For each selected angle: 2-3 tweet variations (280 chars each)
- Each uses the angle's message
- Each references kernel elements
- Note which kernel element powers each tweet

## YouTube (select 2-3 angles from YouTube angles)
- For each selected angle: 2-3 video hook variations (60-90 second scripts)
- Each demonstrates the angle's insight
- Each uses specific kernel examples
- Note which examples from kernel

## SEO (select 2-3 angles from SEO angles)
- For each selected angle: 2-3 headline + opening paragraph variations
- Each answers the search intent
- Each previews the kernel's pattern
- Note which search query this serves

## Guide (select 2-3 angles from Guide angles)
- For each selected angle: 2-3 introduction + structure variations
- Each establishes the pattern
- Each promises specific kernel content
- Note how this differentiates from competitors

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Select first, draft second**: Don't draft all angles - pick the best 2-3 per channel
2. **Use real kernel elements**: Reference actual device names, quotes, effects
3. **Stay true to the angle**: Each draft should embody that specific message
4. **Make it concrete**: Show what the angle looks like as actual content
5. **Note what works**: Add brief observation on each draft

OUTPUT FORMAT:

You must output valid JSON in this exact structure:

{{
  "stage": "5A",
  "book_title": "___BOOK_TITLE_PLACEHOLDER___",
  "selection_rationale": {{
    "social": "why you selected these 2-3 social angles",
    "youtube": "why you selected these 2-3 youtube angles",
    "seo": "why you selected these 2-3 seo angles",
    "guide": "why you selected these 2-3 guide angles"
  }},
  "drafts": [
    {{
      "angle_index": 1,
      "angle_message": "the original message",
      "channel": "social",
      "selection_reason": "why this angle over others",
      "variations": [
        {{
          "content": "the actual draft content",
          "kernel_references": ["device names used"],
          "notes": "why this might work or not"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ],
  "observations": {{
    "strongest_angles": ["which angles produced best drafts"],
    "weakest_angles": ["which angles were hard to draft"],
    "cross_channel_potential": ["which angles work across multiple channels"],
    "thread_candidates": ["which messages could unify a funnel"]
  }}
}}

IMPORTANT: Aim for 8-12 total angle drafts (select 2-3 angles per channel), NOT all 16 angles.

Begin your analysis.
