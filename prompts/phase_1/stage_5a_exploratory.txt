You are creating exploratory content drafts from message angles.

Your task is Stage 5A of KDD: Generate draft content to test which message angles work as actual content.

MESSAGE ANGLES FROM STAGE 3:
---
{angles_json}
---

TEXT KERNEL (source material):
---
Pattern: {kernel_pattern}
Core Dynamic: {core_dynamic}
Reader Effect: {reader_effect}

Priority Devices:
{device_list_with_effects}

Sample Quotes:
{sample_quotes}

YOUR TASK:

For each message angle, generate 2-3 draft variations appropriate to its channel. These are EXPLORATORY — don't over-polish. We're testing which angles work.

FOR EACH ANGLE, PRODUCE:

## Social (if channel = social)
- 2-3 tweet variations (280 chars each)
- Each uses the angle's message
- Each references kernel elements
- Note which kernel element powers each tweet

## YouTube (if channel = youtube)
- 2-3 video hook variations (60-90 second scripts)
- Each demonstrates the angle's insight
- Each uses specific kernel examples
- Note which examples from kernel

## SEO (if channel = seo)
- 2-3 headline + opening paragraph variations
- Each answers the search intent
- Each previews the kernel's pattern
- Note which search query this serves

## Guide (if channel = guide)
- 2-3 introduction + structure variations
- Each establishes the pattern
- Each promises specific kernel content
- Note how this differentiates from competitors

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Use real kernel elements**: Reference actual device names, quotes, effects
2. **Stay true to the angle**: Each draft should embody that specific message
3. **Don't filter yet**: Generate options even if uncertain
4. **Make it concrete**: Show what the angle looks like as actual content
5. **Note what works**: Add brief observation on each draft

OUTPUT FORMAT:

You must output valid JSON in this exact structure:

{{
  "stage": "5A",
  "book_title": "___BOOK_TITLE_PLACEHOLDER___",
  "drafts": [
    {{
      "angle_index": 1,

      "channel": "social",

        }}
