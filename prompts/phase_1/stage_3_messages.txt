You are deriving content messaging from literary analysis.

Your task is to apply Stage 3 of the Kernel-Derived Distribution (KDD) methodology: Message Derivation.

TEXT KERNEL:
---
Book: To Kill a Mockingbird
Pattern: {pattern}
Core Dynamic: {core_dynamic}
Reader Effect: {reader_effect}

Priority Devices:
{device_list}
---

AUDIENCE PROFILE (from Stage 1):
---
{audience_segments_summary}

High-Intent Searches:
{search_terms}
---

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK:

The core principle of KDD is: **Messages DERIVE from kernel properties, not imposed by marketing templates.**

Each message angle should:
1. Address a specific audience pain point
2. Reference specific kernel elements (pattern, devices, effects)
3. Show how the kernel's structure solves the pain point
4. Be channel-appropriate (format/length/style)

TASK:

For each channel type, generate 3-5 distinct message angles.

CHANNELS:

1. **Social (Twitter/Instagram)**
   - Format: 280 characters max
   - Purpose: Agitate + tease insight
   - Example: "Everyone knows Scout is the narrator. Few realize she's also the DEVICE that makes the whole pattern work. Here's how 🧵"

2. **YouTube (5-10 min videos)**
   - Format: Video concept + hook
   - Purpose: Demonstrate method with examples
   - Example: "I'll show you the one pattern that explains every major scene in TKAM - watch me apply it to Ch. 10, 15, and 28"

3. **SEO (Landing pages)**
   - Format: Page headline + value prop
   - Purpose: Answer search intent + offer solution
   - Example: "Why Scout's Narration Matters: The Pattern That Changes Everything" → Addresses "why is Scout's POV important"

4. **Guide (PDF download)**
   - Format: Guide positioning statement
   - Purpose: Promise comprehensive pattern delivery
   - Example: "This guide reveals the one structural pattern that organized TKAM - once you see it, you'll never read the same way"

For EACH message angle, provide:

1. **channel**: Which channel (Social/YouTube/SEO/Guide)
2. **message**: The actual message/hook/headline
3. **kernel_elements**: Which devices, pattern, or effects power this?
4. **pain_point**: Which audience pain point does this address?
5. **hook_type**: Is this agitation/revelation/method/insight?
6. **why_this_derives**: Brief explanation of how this emerges from the kernel (not imposed)

CONSTRAINTS:

- Each angle must reference SPECIFIC kernel elements by name
- Angles within a channel should be DIFFERENTIATED (not variations of same idea)
- This is EXPLORATORY - generate options, don't filter yet
- Messages should feel like they "could only come from this kernel's pattern"

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{{
  "angles": [
    {{
      "channel": "Social",
      "message": "the actual 280-char tweet",
      "kernel_elements": ["Dramatic Irony", "Child Narrator", "Pattern: Innocent Revelation"],
      "pain_point": "Students see Scout as just a character, miss her structural function",
      "hook_type": "revelation",
      "why_this_derives": "The pattern IS innocent revelation - Scout's dual role (child/adult) is the mechanism. Message emerges from pattern structure, not marketing formula."

IMPORTANT: Generate 3-5 angles per channel (12-20 total angles).

Begin your analysis.
