        <h2>What the Novel Does</h2>
        <p><em>Jane Eyre</em> follows an orphaned girl who grows from a powerless child into an independent woman. Jane moves through different stages of life — from the cruel Reed household to Lowood School, then to Thornfield Hall where she falls in love with her employer Mr. Rochester.</p>

        <p>The story is told by Jane herself, looking back on her life from adulthood. This creates a double perspective — we experience events through young Jane's eyes while hearing the wisdom of the older Jane who survived it all.</p>

        <div class="scaffold">
            <p class="scaffold-question">Ask yourself: Why does it matter that Jane tells her own story?</p>
            <p>First-person narration gives us direct access to Jane's thoughts and feelings. We don't just watch her develop — we experience her moral struggles from the inside.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    
    <section class="section">
        <h2>The Central Pattern: Moral Bildungsroman</h2>
        <p>A bildungsroman is a coming-of-age story that follows a character's development from youth to maturity. The "moral" part means Jane's growth focuses specifically on developing her ethical principles and sense of right and wrong.</p>

        <p>This pattern creates two layers of understanding:</p>
        <ul class="concept-list">
            <li>Immediate emotional access — we feel Jane's pain, anger, and love as she experiences them</li>
            <li>Mature moral perspective — the older Jane guides us toward understanding what these experiences mean</li>
            <li>Character-mediated alignment — everything we see is filtered through Jane's consciousness and moral framework</li>
            <li>Temporal distance — the gap between experiencing Jane and narrating Jane creates space for wisdom</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="scaffold">
            <p class="scaffold-question">Ask yourself: Why call this "moral" development rather than just growing up?</p>
            <p>Jane doesn't just learn practical life skills. She develops a strong ethical code that she refuses to compromise, even when it costs her love or security.</p>

        <h2>Key Techniques</h2>
        
        <div class="device">
            <h3 class="device-name">First-Person Narration</h3>
            <p class="quote"><em>"There was no possibility of taking a walk that day"</em></p>
            <ul class="concept-list">
                <li>Simple, direct statement that immediately puts us in Jane's perspective</li>
                <li>Creates intimacy — we're hearing Jane's private thoughts</li>
                <li>The calm, measured tone suggests this is the older Jane reflecting back</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This creates immediate access to Jane's subjective experience while maintaining temporal distance through the mature narrative voice. We're inside her world from the first sentence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="device">
            <h3 class="device-name">Symbolism</h3>
            <p class="quote"><em>"the chestnut-tree. It stood up, black and riven"</em></p>
            <ul class="concept-list">
                <li>The tree is literally split by lightning after Jane and Rochester's engagement</li>
                <li>"Black and riven" suggests destruction and division</li>
                <li>Jane interprets this as a prophetic symbol of trouble ahead</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This creates intimate access to Jane's moral interpretation while maintaining formal distance through her reflective analysis. The symbol reveals Jane's ability to read moral meaning in the natural world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="device">
            <h3 class="device-name">Metaphor</h3>
            <p class="quote"><em>"To me, he was in reality become no longer flesh, but marble"</em></p>
            <ul class="concept-list">
                <li>Jane describes St. John Rivers as transformed from living person to cold stone</li>
                <li>"Marble" suggests hardness, coldness, lifelessness</li>
                <li>The transformation happened "to me" — this is Jane's perception, not objective truth</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This creates intimate access to Jane's moral perception of relationships without love. The metaphor establishes how duty divorced from feeling becomes dehumanizing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="device">
            <h3 class="device-name">Symbolism</h3>
            <p class="quote"><em>"red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement"</em></p>
            <ul class="concept-list">
                <li>Young Jane hides behind curtains in the window seat</li>
                <li>"Shrined" suggests both protection and isolation</li>
                <li>"Double retirement" emphasizes her complete separation from the family</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The curtained enclosure symbolizes Jane's marginalized position and need for protection. This foreshadows her moral journey toward finding legitimate shelter and belonging.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>The novel follows a chronological structure that mirrors the stages of moral development. Jane moves through five key locations — Gateshead, Lowood, Thornfield, Marsh End, and finally back to Rochester — with each representing a different moral challenge.</p>

        <p>This linear progression creates a clear bildungsroman arc. Each stage builds Jane's moral strength until she can return to Rochester as his equal rather than his dependent.</p>

        <p>The retrospective narration allows the mature Jane to guide us through this development. We see both the struggling girl and the wise woman she becomes.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Themes</h2>
        <p><strong>Equality in relationships:</strong> Jane refuses to be either Rochester's mistress or St. John's obedient wife. She insists on moral and emotional equality, achieved through her own strength rather than social position.</p>

        <p><strong>Independence versus belonging:</strong> Jane must learn to maintain her moral independence while still forming meaningful connections. She rejects both isolation and submission as false choices.</p>

        <p><strong>Moral principle versus passion:</strong> Throughout the novel, Jane faces choices between what she wants and what she believes is right. Her moral development involves learning when to compromise and when to hold firm.</p>

        <div class="scaffold">
            <p class="scaffold-question">Ask yourself: How do these themes connect to the moral bildungsroman pattern?</p>
            <p>Each theme represents a moral challenge Jane must work through to reach maturity. The first-person retrospective narration lets us experience both her struggles and her ultimate wisdom about resolving these conflicts.</p>
