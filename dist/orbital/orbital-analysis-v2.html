        <h1>Orbital</h1>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>What the Novel Does</h2>
            
            <p><em>Orbital</em> follows six astronauts circling Earth on the International Space Station. Not much "happens" in a traditional sense—no disaster, no villain, no dramatic rescue. Instead, Harvey tracks a single day as the crew floats through their routines, watches Earth spin below, and thinks.</p>
            
            <p>The novel constantly shifts between two perspectives:</p>
            
            <ul class="concept-list">
                <li><strong>Intimate human moments</strong> — someone gripping a table handle, someone dozing, someone remembering childhood</li>
                <li><strong>Vast cosmic scale</strong> — the Earth reeling below, typhoons forming, continents sliding past</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This back-and-forth is the engine of the book. Harvey uses an omniscient narrator—one who can see into everyone's thoughts and can also pull back to watch from an enormous distance.</p>
            
            <div class="scaffold">
                <p class="scaffold-question">Ask yourself: What does it feel like to read this?</p>
                <p>You feel close to the characters. You also feel pulled back, watching them like specks against the black. Both feelings happen at once. That's the point.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
        
        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Central Pattern: Cosmic Meditation</h2>
            
            <p>Harvey's approach creates what we can call <em>Cosmic Meditation</em>. Here's how it works:</p>
            
            <ul class="concept-list">
                <li><strong>Omniscient perspective</strong> — the narrator sees everything, inside and outside the characters</li>
                <li><strong>Contemplative tone</strong> — slow, thoughtful, elegiac (like mourning something)</li>
                <li><strong>Constant scale-shifting</strong> — from a hand-span to the entire planet, often in the same sentence</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The result: readers develop a kind of meditative awareness. You see the astronauts' fragile lives against the indifferent vastness of space. This makes their small moments feel both precious and insignificant.</p>
            
            <div class="scaffold">
                <p class="scaffold-question">Why "meditation"?</p>
                <p>Because the novel doesn't argue or explain. It sits with images. It lets you feel the contrast between human scale and cosmic scale without telling you what to conclude.</p>

            <h2>Key Techniques</h2>
            
            <div class="device">
                <p class="device-name">Juxtaposition</p>
                <p class="quote">"surrounded by the strangeness of humans, all their odd cuffs"</p>
                <p>Harvey places two things side by side:</p>
                <ul class="concept-list">
                    <li>"Strangeness of humans" — as if the narrator is an alien, looking at us from outside</li>
                    <li>"Odd cuffs" — a tiny, mundane detail (shirt cuffs, sleeve cuffs)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The effect: humans look strange when seen from cosmic distance, yet we zoom into something as small as cuffs. This is the pattern in miniature—vast and intimate in the same moment.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="device">
                <p class="device-name">Lyrical Prose</p>
                <p class="quote">"the handles of the foldable table. Outside the earth reels"</p>
                <p>Notice what's next to what:</p>
                <ul class="concept-list">
                    <li>"Handles of the foldable table" — something an astronaut might touch, ordinary, domestic</li>
                    <li>"The earth reels" — the entire planet, spinning, enormous</li>
                </ul>
                <p>One sentence. Inside the station, outside the station. Human grip, planetary motion. Harvey's prose constantly makes these leaps.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="device">
                <p class="device-name">Imagery</p>
                <p class="quote">"billion years of atoms moving in cosmic commotion until they"</p>
                <p>This imagery does something specific:</p>
                <ul class="concept-list">
                    <li>Starts enormous: "billion years," "cosmic commotion"</li>
                    <li>Ends with "until they—" pointing toward something specific, human, now</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The sentence compresses cosmic time into a single moment. All those billions of years led to this. The scale is overwhelming, but it lands on something concrete.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="device">
                <p class="device-name">Free Indirect Discourse</p>
                <p class="quote">"The thoughts you have in orbit are so grandiose and"</p>
                <p>Whose voice is this? The narrator's? The astronaut's? Both at once.</p>
                <p>Free indirect discourse blends them together. We're inside someone's thought ("the thoughts you have") but it's also a general statement about orbit, about consciousness expanding when you leave Earth.</p>
                <p>The incomplete sentence—"so grandiose and"—captures how these thoughts exceed what words can hold.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
        
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            
            <p>The novel is organised by orbits. Each chapter is named after an orbit number: "Orbit 3, ascending," "Orbit 8, descending," and so on.</p>
            
            <p>This structure matters because:</p>
            
            <ul class="concept-list">
                <li><strong>Repetition with variation</strong> — the station keeps circling, but each pass shows something different</li>
                <li><strong>No traditional climax</strong> — the book resists dramatic peaks; instead, it sustains a contemplative rhythm</li>
                <li><strong>Time as cycle</strong> — dawn and dusk happen sixteen times per day in orbit; time feels different up there</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The ending is deliberately open. There's no resolution, no return to Earth in the narrative. This mirrors the novel's themes—environmental crisis has no neat ending, and the cosmic perspective Harvey builds refuses to collapse back into comfortable human scale.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Themes</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Human fragility against cosmic indifference.</strong> The astronauts are separated from instant death by a thin metal wall. Harvey makes you feel this constantly—how precarious human existence is, how vast and uncaring space remains.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Connection and isolation.</strong> The astronauts are intensely connected to each other and to Earth (they can see everything). Yet they're also utterly isolated—floating in a metal can, unable to touch the planet they watch.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Environmental urgency.</strong> From orbit, the astronauts see typhoons, deforestation, the fragility of the atmosphere. The contemplative tone carries an underlying urgency: this is what we're losing.</p>
            
            <div class="scaffold">
                <p class="scaffold-question">How do these themes connect to the pattern?</p>
                <p>The Cosmic Meditation pattern—shifting between intimate and vast—is what makes these themes land. You can't feel human fragility without seeing the cosmic scale. You can't feel connection and isolation without experiencing both perspectives simultaneously.</p>
