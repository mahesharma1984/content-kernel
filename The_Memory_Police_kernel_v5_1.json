      "chapter_text": "and watching television when the doorbell rang. From the violent way it rang, I could tell that something unpleasant was about to happen. \u201cTake us to your father\u2019s offi ce,\u201d said one of the officers fr om the Mem ory Police whom I fo und standing in the doorway. There were five of th em, dressed in dark green uniforms, with heavy belts and black boots. They wore leather gloves and their guns were half hidden in holsters on their hips. The men were nearly identical, with only three badges on their collars to tell them apart \u2014though I had no time to study them closely. \u201cTake u s to your father\u2019s off ice,\u201d echoed a second man, his tone th e same as the man who had spoken first. This one wore badges in the shapes of a diamond, a bean, and a trapezoid. \u201cMy father died five years ago,\u201d I said as slowly and evenly as I could, trying to remain calm. \u201cWe kn ow,\u201d said another man, wearing insignia shaped like a wedge, a hexagon, and the letter \u201cT.\u201d As though his words had been some sort of signal, the five officers marched into th e house without even removing their shoes. Suddenly, the corridor was filled with the clatter of boots and guns. \u201cI\u2019ve just cleaned the carpet s,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease take off your shoes.\u201d I knew I should hav e said something more forceful, but this sim ple request was all that came to mind. It hardly m attered, since th ey paid no attention to me and were already climbing the stairs.They seemed to know exactl y where they were going, an d a moment later they were in my father\u2019s office on the east side of the house, setting to work with remarkable efficiency. First , one of them o pened all the windows, which had been sealed shut since my father\u2019s death. Meanwhile, another one used a long, thin tool like a scalpel to force the locks on the cabinets and the desk drawers. The rest ran their fingers over every inch of the walls, apparently in search of secret compartments. Then they all began to riff le through my father\u2019s papers, pawing at his notes, drafts, books, and photographs. When they came upon something they considered dangerous\u2014in other words, anything that contained the word \u201cbird\u201d\u2014they threw the item unceremoniously on the floor. Leaning against the doorframe, I fiddled nervously with the lock as I watched them work. The Memory Police, just a s I\u2019d heard, went about their assigned tasks in the most efficient manner. They worked in silence, their eyes fixed, making no unnecessary movements. The only sound was the rustling of papers, like the fluttering of wings. In n o time at all, a mountain of paper had formed on the floor. Nearly everything in t he room had to do with my father\u2019s work in some way. Documents covered with my father\u2019s familiar handwriting and the photographs he had taken at the observatory flew out of the officers\u2019 hands one after the other. There was no doubt th at they were creating chaos, but they went about it in such a precise manner that they gave an impression of careful order. I felt I should tr y to stop them , but my heart was pounding and I didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cPlease be careful,\u201d I murmured, but they ignored me. \u201cTh ese are the only th ings I have from my father.\u201d Not one of them so much as turned to look at me, and my voice was lost in the pile of memories on the floor. Then one of th e officers reached for the handle on the bot tom drawer of the desk. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in there that has to do with birds,\u201d I c ried out. It was the drawer where my father kept family letters and photographs. The officer\u2014this one wore a badge mad e up of concentric circles, as well as one shaped like a rectangle andanother like a teardrop\u2014continued his search. The only offending item in the drawer was a photograph of our family with a brightly colored rare bird\u2014I no longer recall the name\u2014that my fa ther had managed to hatch from an egg he had incubated. The man carefully gathered up the remaining photographs and letters and put them back in the drawer . That was the only kindnes s shown that day. When they had finished sorting through everything, they took the items piled on the floor and shoved them into large black plastic bags they pulled from pockets inside their jackets. It was clear fr om the brutal way th ey stuffed the bags that they were going to dispose of everyth ing they took. They had n ot been looking for anything in par ticular; they had simply wanted to eliminate all trace of anything relating to birds. The first duty of the Memory Police was to enforce the disappearances. I realized at some point that this search was unlike the day they to ok my mother away. Today, they seemed to have found everything the y wanted, and I was fairly sure they would not be back. M y father was dead, and the memory of the birds was gradually fading from the house. The sea rch had taken an hour and had yielded ten large b ags. The office had grown quit e warm from the bright s un that streamed in. The polished badges shone on the officers\u2019 collars, but none of the men appeared to be sweating or suffering from the heat in any wa y. They shouldered two bags each and carri ed them to the truck they had left parked outside. The room had changed completely. The traces of my father\u2019s presence, which I had done my best to preserve, had vanished, replaced by an emptiness tha t would not be filled. I stood in the middle of that emptiness, feeling myself on the verge of being drawn into its terrible depth.I make my living now from m y writing. So far, I\u2019ve published three n ovels. The first was about a piano tuner who wanders through music shops and concert halls searching for her lover, a pianist, who has vanished. She relies solely on the sound of his music t hat lingers in her ear s. The second was about a ballerina who lost her rig ht leg in an accident and lives in a greenho use with her boy friend, who is a botan ist. And the third was about a young woman nursing her younger brother, who suffers from a disease that is destroying his chromosomes. Each o ne told the story of something that had b een disappeared. E veryone likes that sort of thing. But here on the island, writing novels is o ne of the least impressive, most underappreciated occupations one can pursue. No one could claim that the island is overflowing with books. The library, a shabby single-floor wooden building next to the rose garden, ha s only a handful of patrons, no matter when one visits, and the books seem to cow er on the shelves, fearful of crumbling to dust at the slightest touch. They will all, in the end, be tossed out without being c ared for or rebound\u2014which is why the collection never grows. But no one ever complains. The bookstores are much the same. Nearly deserted, and the managers appe ar almost surly behind their stacks of unso ld books with yellowing covers. Few people here have any need for novels. I ge nerally begin writing at ab out two o\u2019clock in the aftern oon and keep at it until nearly midnight, yet I rarely finish more than five pages. I en joy writing slowly, filling each square on the paper, one character at a time. There\u2019s no need to hurry. I take my time.I work in my father\u2019s old room. But it\u2019s much neater and more orderly now, since my novels require no notes or other materials. My des k holds only a stack of paper, a pencil, a small knife to sharpen it, and an eraser. Though I\u2019ve tried, I\u2019ve found no way to fill in the voids left by the Memory Police. When evening comes, I go out to walk for an hour or so. I follow the coastal road to the dock, and on the way home I take a path over the hill that passes the observatory. The ferry has b een tied to the dock for a very long time and is now co mpletely covered with rust. No passengers board it and it can no longer take them an ywhere. It, too, is among th e things that have been disappeared from the island. The name of the boat is painted on the bow, but the salt air has sco ured it away, leaving it illegible. The windows are coated with du st, and the hull and anchor chain and propeller are covered with m ussels and seaweed\u2014as though it is an enormous sea creature that is slowly turning to stone. My nur se\u2019s husband had once served as mechanic on the boat. After th e ferry had disappeared, he worked as a watchman for a warehouse by the docks. But at some point he retired and he lives now on the abandoned boat. On my walk, I invariably stopped in to chat with him. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d he as ked one evening, offering me a chair. \u201c Are you making progress with your novel?\u201d There are lots of places to sit, so depending on the weather or our mood we might find ourselves occupying a bench up on deck or relaxing on a comfortable couch in the first-class lounge. \u201cSlowly,\u201d I told him. \u201cWell, the most important thing is that you take care of yourself.\u201d He nodded to him self and added, \u201cThere aren\u2019t many people w ho can sit all day at a desk and make up such complicated things right out of their head. If your parents were here to see you, they would be so proud.\u201d \u201cA n ovel isn\u2019t a s marvelous as all that. To me, taking apa rt a boat engine, fixing it, and putting it all back together again is much more mysterious and wonderful.\u201d\u201cNo, no . The ferry has been disappeared and there\u2019s noth ing more to be said about it.\u201d We fell silent then for a moment. \u201cAh,\u201d h e said at last. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to get some excellent peaches. Why don\u2019t we have one?\u201d He went into the tiny galley next to the boiler room, where he laid out slices of peach on a plate lined w ith ice and topped the m with a sprig of mint. Then h e made a po t of strong green tea. He was truly gifted when it comes to machines, food, and plants. I\u2019ve always given him one of the first copies of each of my books. \u201cSo this is y our new novel, \u201d h e would s ay each time, pronouncing th e word with g reat care and taking the book in both hands, as though he were r eceiving a sacrament. \u201cThank you, thank you,\u201d he would repeat, as his voice grew almost tearful and I felt increasingly embarrassed. But he has never read a single page of any of my books. Once, when I told him I\u2019d love to know what he thinks of them, he demurred. \u201cI could n\u2019t pos sibly say,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you read a novel to the end, the n it\u2019s over. I would ne ver want to do something as wasteful as that. I\u2019d much rather keep it here with me, safe and sound, forever.\u201d Then h e placed the book in the little altar to the sea gods in the ship\u2019s wheelhouse and joined his wrinkled hands in prayer. As we enjoyed our snack, we talked about all sorts of things\u2014 but mo st often we spoke of our memories. Of my mother and father, my old nurse, the observatory, sculptures, and the distant past when one could still take a boat to other places. But our memories were diminishing day by day, for when something disappeared from the island, all memory of it vanished, too. We divided the last bit of peach and repeated the same stories to each other, allowing the fruit to dissolve, ever so slowly, on our tongues. When the sun began to tilt down toward the sea, I clim bed down from the boat. Though the gangway wasn\u2019t particularly steep, the old man came out to escort me. He treated me as though I were still a little girl. \u201cTake care on the way home.\u201d\u201cI will,\u201d I told him. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d He s tood watching me as I w alked away, never moving until I was completely out of sight. Leaving the harbor behind, my next stop was the observa tory at the top of the hill. But I never lingered long. I gazed ou t at the sea, taking a few deep breaths, and then walked down again. The Memory Police have don e their work here, much as they did in my father\u2019s study, leaving it little more than a ruin. Nothing at a ll remains to remind a visitor that it had once been a place to observe wild birds. The researchers, too, have scattered. I stood at the window, whe re I once stood with my father looking out through binoculars, and even now small winged creatures occa sionally flitted by, but they were no more than reminders that birds mean nothing at all to me anymore. As I climbed d own the hill and made my way through to wn, the sun was setting. The island was quieter in the evening. People coming home from work walked with their heads lowered, children hurried along. Even the sputtering engines of market trucks, empty after the day\u2019s sales, were muffled and forlorn. Silence fell around us all, as though we were stee ling ourselves for the next disapp earance, which would no doubt come \u2014perhaps even tomorrow. So it was that evening came to the island.On Wednesday afternoon, on my way to take my manuscript to my publishe r, I had an encounter with the Memory Police. It was the third time I\u2019d seen them this month, and they seemed to grow a bit more brutal each time. It occurred to me that it has been fifteen years since they first appeared. In those days, it w as just becoming obvious that some people, like my mother, did n ot lose their memories of th e things that had disappeared, and the Memory Police began taking them all away. Though no one had any idea where they were being held. I ha d just got ten off the bu s and was waiting to cross the street when three of their dar k green trucks with canvas covers in back rumbled into the inte rsection. The cars along the street slowed and pulled to the curb to let them pass. The trucks stopped in front of a building that housed a dentist\u2019s office, an in surance company, and a dance studio. Ten men from the Memory Police jumped out and hurried into the building. The people in the street wat ched tensely, some ducking into nearby alleys, and they all seemed to hope that the scene unfolding before them would be over before they themselves were pulled into it. I clu tched the envelope that held my manuscript and stood stock-still beh ind a lamp pole. Several times, as I wai ted, the traffic l ight cha nged from green to yellow to red and back again to green. No one ventured into the crosswalk. The passenger s on the streetcar peere d out the windows. At some point I realized that my envelope had gotten completely wrinkled. A s hort time later, the soun d of footsteps could be he ard coming from the building\u2014the forceful, rhythmic boots of the Memory Police mixed with quieter, more uncertain steps. Then aline of people emerged: two middle-aged gentlemen, a woman in her thirties with dyed brown hair, and a thin girl barely in her teens. Though the cold weather had not yet set in, they each w ore several layers of shirts, an ove rcoat each, and mufflers and scarves wrapped around their necks. They held bags and suitcases that were obviously stuffed full. It seemed they had been t rying to bring with them as many useful items as they were able to carry. Judging from the loose buttons, fluttering shoelaces, and bits of clothing protruding from their bags, it was clear that they had been fo rced to pack quickly. And now they were being marched out of the building with wea pons at their backs. Still, th eir faces were calm and they stared into the distance with eyes as still as a lonely swamp deep in the woods. In those eyes, no doubt, were all sorts of memories that had been lost to us. As always, the Memory Police, badges glinting from their collars, went about their appointed task with terrible efficiency. The four were led past the spot where I was standing, and I caught just a whiff of an antiseptic smell\u2014perhaps they had come from the dentist\u2019s office. They were loaded, one after another, into the back of one of the truc ks, the guns trained on them the entire time. The young girl, wh o was last in line, carr ied an orange bag decorated with an appliqu\u00e9 of a bear. She had thrown this into the truck and was attempting to climb up herself, but it was too high and she ended up falling on her back. I cried out before I could stop myself and dropped my envelope. The pages of my manuscript scattered over the sidewalk, and the other bystanders turned to look disapprovingly. They were afraid of creating a disturba nce, of giving the police re ason to notice them. A boy who was standing nearby",

      "chapter_text": "the entranceway. We passed several other people carrying heavy paper bags or bundles. The street was icy i n places and there were sno wdrifts, making it difficult to pull th e cart. My books, which had been loaded in neat bundles, were soon reduced to a jumble in the cart, but since we were taking them to be burned, it didn\u2019t seem to matter. \u201cIf y ou get tired, you can climb on the cart and take a re st,\u201d said the old man. \u201cThanks, but I\u2019m fine,\u201d I told him. We made our way along the main street, skirted the mar ket, and arrived at last at the park in the center of town. The whole area was filled with light and heat. A great mountain of books was already burnin g, sending sparks high into the night sky. A crowd had gathered around the fire, and Memory Police officers could be seen standing among the trees just outside the circle. \u201cWhat an incredible sight\u2026,\u201d the old man murmured. The flames, like some enormous living creature, shot up to the sky, higher than the streetlights, higher than the telephone poles. When t he wind blew, a great mass of burning pages danced into the air. The snow had melted all around and the mud su cked at your shoes with each step. A n orange light illuminated the slide, the seesaw, the park benches, the walls of the restroom building.The mo on and the stars were nowhere to be seen, as though they had bee n scattered by the b rilliance of the flames, and only the corpses of burned books lit the sky. The people in the crowd, che eks blazing with the fire, sta red, openmouthed, at the spectacle before them. Stunned and silent, as if attending a solemn ceremony, they made no move to brush away the sparks that rained down on them. The pile of bo oks was taller than I was. Some had not yet caught fire, but it was impossible to read the titles. I squinted at the spines, though it would have made no difference had I been able to recogni ze them. Still, by watching them until the moment they dis appeared, I hoped to preserve in my memory so mething from their pages. There were books of all sorts\u2014some in slipcases, some bound in leather, weighty tomes a nd slender novellas\u2014piled together awaiting their turn in the flam es. From time to time, the mountain would collapse with a muffled whoosh, the flames would s hoot up, and the heat would grow more intense. After one of th ese moments, a young woman suddenly mo ved out of the circle of onlookers, climbed up on a bench, and began to shout somethin g. Startled, the old man and I exchanged a nervous glance. Others in the crowd turned to look at her. She wa s screaming so frantically that it was impossible to understand what she was saying. Arms flailing, saliva flying, she was clearly agitated, but it was hard to tell whether she was angry or just distraught. She was dressed in a shabby overcoat and checked pants, and her long hair was tied up in a braid. On top of her head, perched at a jaunty angle, she wore an odd thing made of soft material. As she rocked violently to and fro, I found myself fearing it would come tumbling off. \u201cDo you think she\u2019s mad?\u201d I whispered to the old man. \u201cI wonder,\u201d he answered, crossing his arms. \u201cShe seems to want them to put out the fire.\u201d \u201cBut why?\u201d \u201cTo stop the novels from disappearing, I suppose.\u201d\u201cDo you mean, she\u2019s\u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014unable to rid herself of her memories. Poor thing.\u201d Her cries gradually rose to so mething close to a scream, but of course no one made a move t o extinguish the enormous mountain of flames. The people nearby just watched her with pitying looks. \u201cThey\u2019ll take her if she goes on like that,\u201d I said, starting toward the bench. \u201cShe\u2019s got to get away, we\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afr aid it\u2019s too late,\u201d said the old man, catching hold of me before I could move. Three member s of the Memory Police had appeared from the woods and were already pulling on her arms. She tried to resist, clinging to the bench, but it was hopeless. The thing on h er head fell into the mud. \u201cNo one can erase the stories!\u201d The last words she said as they dragged her away were the only ones I was able to und erstand clearly. I he ard sighs f rom the people around us as they turned b ack to stare at the fire. I looked d own at the thing she had left on the ground, which was now even more limp and filthy than it had been. Her words continued to ring in my ears\u2014\u201cNo one can erase the stories.\u201d \u201cOf course! A hat!\u201d I was su ddenly able to remember. \u201cThe man who lives across the street used to make them, b ut they disappeared ye ars ago. You wore them on your head\u2014the way she did\u2014didn\u2019t you?\u201d I looked up at the old man, but he just seemed puzzled. At t hat moment someone mo ved out of the crowd, picked up the hat, and, w ithout a word, tossed it into the fire. It spun as it flew and then fell among the flames. \u201cWell then, we should be getting on with it,\u201d the old man said. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I said, looking up from the spot where the hat lay burning. We left the car t near the fountain and walked toward the fire, our arms filled with books. B ut as we approached, the heat grewmore fierce and sparks threatened to burn our clothes and hair, so we could not get very close. \u201cYou sh ould keep back,\u201d the old man said, as always worried for my safety. \u201cI can manage.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. W e can\u2019t get closer anyway. Why don\u2019t we just throw them from here?\u201d I took a book with a pea-green cover decorated with a picture of f ruit and tossed it toward the fire. I\u2019d thrown it as h ard as I could, b ut it barely reached the edge of the pile. The n ext one, thrown by the old man, made it a little farther up the side. The people around us glanced in our direction, but they said nothing and their faces remained expressionless. We continued throwing the books, one after the other, without flipping through the pages or so much as glancin g at the covers. We repeated the movements almost automatically, as if performing som e solemn duty. Still, as each volume left m y hand, I f elt a slight t winge, as though the hollow place in my memory were being enlarged book by book. \u201cI had no idea books burned so well,\u201d I said. \u201cI supp ose it\u2019s because they pack so much paper into such a small object,\u201d said the old ma n, as he continued tossing them into the fire. \u201cIt may take a long time for every word to disappear.\u201d \u201cI w ouldn\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll be nothing but ashes by tomorrow morning,\u201d he said. Pulling a towel from his pocket, he wiped the sweat and soot from his face. When we\u2019d burned about hal f the books, we left the park and once again began wheeling the cart through the town. Working so close to the heat of the enor mous blaze had tired us out, so we were looking for a smaller fire to finish the job. The town was quiet. I could sense the roughness in the air that I\u2019d felt after other disappearances, but somehow people seemed calmer . There were a lmost no cars on the streets, with the exception of the Memory Police trucks, and though the crowds were thick, no one seemed to be stopping to talk. The only sound was that of burning books.We wal ked aimlessly, and the cart was easier to pull now that our load was lighter. We turn ed north, along the street w here the streetcar ran, cut through the parking lot at city hall, and made our way along a street lined with houses. From time to time we came upon a vacant lot where a small fire was burning. \u201cWould you mind if we joined you?\u201d the old man asked the people standing around, and we would stop to warm our hands and bur n an armful of books. We might have burned the rest of the cartload at any of these fires, but we worried about the danger of the fires spr eading, so we repeated the process: burning some books, pulling the cart farther along, finding another fire. The night was deepening but fir es continued to burn. I wou ld have thought the number of novels on the island was relatively small, but pillars of smoke rose in many places with no sign of stopping. We pas sed the community center, a gas station, the cannery, a company dormitory, and arr ived at last at the sea. Following the coast road, we came upon gr oups of people gathered around fires on t he sand. The sea had dissolved into the darkness. N o more than a few books remained in the cart, but we walked on. The hill came into view. A fire was raging halfway up the slope. \u201cThe library,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re right,\u201d said the old man, holding up his hands to shade his eyes and squinting at the flames. The roa d up the hill was steep and narrow, so we left the cart and decided to carry the rest of the books in our arms. Under normal circumstances, it wo uld have been too dark to walk this way at night, b ut thanks to th e fire above us, it was nearly as light as d ay. Partway up, we came upon the garden, though the re were no long er any flowers to b e seen. Just the occasional bare, withering stalk, above which sparks danced like glittering flower petals. The library was completely engulfed in flames. Never before had I seen an ything burn as brightly or as beautifully, and the intense light and heat chased away all traces of the fear and sadness I had been feeling. The things about which R h ad beentrying t o persuade me, the w ords the woman had screamed into the fire\u2014everything seemed to recede into the distance. People had gathered to watch the fire, and we could hear them talking. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they had to burn the whole building.\u201d \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing but book s inside, so it\u2019s simpler to just do it all at once.\u201d \u201cI wonder what they\u2019ll do with the land when it\u2019s gone.\u201d \u201cI supp ose they\u2019ll leave it, th e way they did with the garden. But I heard they\u2019ll build a headquarters for the Memory Police someday.\u201d . . . We clim bed a bit farther up the hill to the observatory and found it deserted. The last tim e I had stopped in on a walk during the day, I had thought it seemed largely unchanged, but now, at night, I realized that it was pr actically in ruins. The windows were broken and covered with cob webs. Cabinets and desks had been overturned. And the floor was strewn with trash of all sorts\u2014old mugs, pencil holders, blank ets, shredded documents. W e made our way acros s the room, an d I set the remaining book s by the window where my father and I had watched the birds through his binoculars. \u201cThere could be broken glass , be careful,\u201d said the old man. I nodded as I leaned against the window frame. The library was visible down the slope, through a thick tan gle of underbrush. It seemed so close you could reach out and touch it and, at the same time unreal , like an image on a movie screen. In the darkness, only the flames appeared to move. We held our breath, just as the trees below us and the sea beyond seemed to, as though fearful of disturbing this beautiful scene. \u201cI r emember hearing a sayin g long ago: \u2018Men who start by burning books end by burning other men,\u2019 \u201d I said. \u201cWho said that?\u201d asked the old man, speaking softly and bringing his hand to his chin.\u201cI\u2019ve forgotten, though I\u2019m sure it was someone important. But I wonder if that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed.\u201d \u201cI w onder,\u201d echoed the old m an. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say.\u201d He looked up a t the ceiling, blinked, an d rubbed his chin again. \u201cBu t there\u2019s nothing to be done. It\u2019s not as though they\u2019re burning every printed word. It\u2019s just the n ovels, so there\u2019s no reason to think they\u2019ll go further anytime soon.\u201d \u201cBut what if human beings themselves disappear?\u201d I asked. This wa s the question that had been on my mind. The o ld man swallowed and blinked again. \u201cYou have to stop worryin g about things like that. The disappearances are beyond o ur control. They have nothing to do with us . We\u2019re all going to die anyway, someday, so what\u2019s the difference? We simply have to leave things to fate.\u201d . . . The libr ary continued to burn. I picked up one of the books from the pile a t my feet and threw it out the window. It op ened as it flew through the air, cleare d the underbrush, and fell gently into the flam es. Th e pages had ca ught the breeze, and it flutte red as it flew, as if dancing on air. Next it was the old man\u2019s turn. He chose a thinner, ligh ter volume, so it floated even mo re gracefully before vanishing in the flames. We repeated this ritual over and over, handling each b ook with great care. When t he wind changed, a cu rrent of warm air came blowing in the window . Our feet we re frozen from walking the snowy streets, but our cheeks were warm. \u201cHow did it fe el when the ferry was disappeared?\u201d I as ked him. \u201cIt\u2019s so long ago I don\u2019t really remember.\u201d \u201cDid you worry about how yo u would make a living?\u201d I picked up a thick, heavy book with a brown paper cover. \u201cI s uppose I d id. It was upsetting at first. But don\u2019t wo rry. You\u2019ll find something else to do, and eventually you wo n\u2019t evenremember that you used to write novels.\u201d He stared out the window into the distance. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to go on writing them in secret,\u201d I told him. He let out a little gasp and t urned to look at me. I threw the thick volume into the air with both hands. The paper wrapper made a sound that was almost a sob. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be able to?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, but R told me that I had to, that my soul would die if I didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cHe did, did he?\u2026\u201d The old man\u2019s chin came to rest on his hand ag ain, and a thoughtful look settled over his wrinkled face. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing what he told me to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019 ve been listening to the music box every day, but I don\u2019t feel any different. My los t memories aren\u2019t coming back, and I don\u2019t feel any stronger. All I hear is a lot of strange sounds.\u201d \u201cI k now it m ay not do any good, but I\u2019ve hidden the manuscript I\u2019m working on. I know it\u2019s dangerous, but I don\u2019t want to disappoint R. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll feel any differe nt if my soul withers away, but I don\u2019t think I could stand to see him looking so sad.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019l l keep listening to the music box. What else would I do with su ch a wonderful present?\u201d As he spoke, the old man brushed away so me ash that had land ed on my hair. \u201cYou should take care not to tire yourself, and you m ust tell me if there\u2019s ever anything I can do to help.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d I said. The last book had finally be en tossed out the window. The library building was beginni ng to collapse in upon itself. From time to time, a portion of the roof or a section of wall wou ld come down with a c rash. The circulation desk and the chair s in the reading room could be seen burning in the ruins. I followed the arc of the last book as it tumbled through the air\u2014and sudde nly I realized that, long ago, I had stood at this same window with my father and looked out at a similar sight. I took a deep breath and felt a slight pain, as though a sp ark had found its way into the bottomless swamp of my heart.\u201cA bird.\u201d I reme mbered. The pages of the book had opened and fluttered through the air just the way birds had once spread their wings a nd flown off to distan t places. But this memory, too, was soon erased by the flames, lea ving behind nothing but the burning night.As t he old man had predicted , I soon found another job. The head of the neighborhood association made an introduction for me at a trading company run by an acquaintance. \u201cThey sell spices in bulk. It\u2019s not a large firm, but the owner is an interesting man and the offices are nice enough. He\u2019s apparently looking for a typist.\u201d \u201cA typist?\u201d I said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t interest you?\u201d \u201cI d on\u2019t have m uch experienc e, just a bit when I was at school. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be good enough\u2026\u201d I repeated the word \u201ctypist\u201d silently to myself several times. It seemed to have a special significance. \u201cNot to worry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can learn as you go.",

      "chapter_text": "The owner said as much. At any rate, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have various other duties to start.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m ver y grateful, and I apologize for putting you to so m uch trouble.\u201d I bowed, but all th e while the word \u201ctypist\u201d r epeated itself in my h ead. I tried to recover my faded memory, but it remained distant and vague. \u201cNot at all! Do n\u2019t mention it. I was just connecting the d ots. We all have to pull together after a disappearance.\u201d He smiled with satisfaction. And so I came to work at a spice company, and the rhythm of my days changed drastically. I woke early in the morning, prepared the food, water, and other things R would need during the day, and carried them all to the hidden room. In the evening, when I got hom e from work, I would check to see that R was all right be fore tak ing Don for a walk. After that, I would start makingdinner. At first, it bothered me to be away from the house for ten hours a day. Inevitably, I imagined the worst happening while I was gone, a fire or a robbery or R suddenly falling ill\u2014or another visit from the Memory Police\u2014and besides that, I was much busier now tha n I\u2019d been before. It proved to be fairly difficult t o juggle my job, watching over R, cari ng for Don, and managing th e house, and I rarely ha d time to visit the old man on the boat. But the days passed without any major problems. The spi ce com pany was a pl easant, almost homey place. My duties included dusting, answering the phone, and some basic filing. A nd I was lent a portable typewriter and a typing manual and ask ed to practice at home. It was the first time I had worked outside the house, but it see med as though I would manage well enough. The one thing that bothered me, however, was the strong smell of the spices that came from the warehouse behind the office. The bitter, medicinal odor clung to me like the s tench of rotting fruit. On the other hand, one of the perks of the job was that I received gifts of food from s ome of our clients, like sausage and cheese and corned beef, whi ch had long since vanished f rom the markets and were an enormous treat for the old man, R, and me. . . . I un derstood why I had re acted so strongly to the w ord \u201ctypist\u201d when I reread the manuscript I\u2019d given to R for safekeeping, though in point of fact I was no longer capable of reading a novel, much less writing one. I could read the w ords out loud, but I could no longer understand them as parts of a coherent story w ith a plot to connect th em. They were just characters on the manuscript pag e, and they evoked in me no feeling or atmosphere, no recognizable scene. As I traced the words one b y one and came at last to that word, I remembered that my novel was about a typist. But the discovery only made it clearer that writing the rest would not be as easy as R had suggested. On Frid ay and Saturday evenings, I sat down at my d esk. Putting aside the paperweight, I carefully examined themanuscript, beginning from the first page. But the wor k never went smoothly. I tried various strategies\u2014reading the same line several times, staring at a sin gle word, running my eyes over the words at a stea dy speed\u2014but nothing seemed to help. By the fifth or sixth page, I had invariably lost the will to continue. Then I would f lip through the pages until I came upon a section that looked promising and try the same thing again, but the results were always the same. In th e end, I was so weary that the mere sight of the lines on the paper made me dizzy. But if continuing what I\u2019d al ready written was impossible, it occurred to me that perhaps I could write something new, and so I took out a fres h sheet of paper. To warm up my fingers, I tried writing a, i, u, e, o. Then, taking care to match the size of the characters to the lines on the paper, I continued with ka, ki, ku, ke, ko. And as I wrote these meaningless characters, I began to feel a certain satisfac tion in the knowledge that I was fulfilling R \u2019s hopes for me, even in the tiniest way. But when I erased the characters and the blank lines spread out in front of me, my fingers grew numb and my anxiety return ed with the realization that I had no idea what to write. What had I written? I asked myself. A t night, I would try to recall anything at all about those moments, seated at m y desk, when I had be en searching for words. The typewriter ha d sat at the edge of th e desk, watching me in silence. Fortunately, my coworkers at the spice com pany had not said much ab out my typing practice , since I was making little progress. I would tap the keys at random, producing a stream of metallic clicks. In these moments, I would suddenly have the feeling that a story was coming back to me and I would reach out instinctively to seize it. But the re was nothing for m e to hold. When I could no longer stand to stare at the blank page, I would type a, i, u, e, o, and then, imagining that I would now be able to write something, I would erase th em aga in. But of cou rse nothing came to me, and I would return to a, i, u, e, o. And the process would repeat itself. In the end, all that w as left was a torn page, from the many t imes I\u2019d erased what I\u2019d written. . . .\u201cYou sh ouldn\u2019t force the memories. Just try to untangle th em slowly,\u201d R told me. I had apologized for handing him a blank sheet of pape r, but his response was encouraging and showed no sign of disappointment. \u201cI\u2019ve tried, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s useless.\u201d \u201cYou sh ouldn\u2019t say that. You\u2019re the same person now that you were when you wrote novels. The only thing that\u2019s changed is that the books have been burned . But even if paper itself disappears, words will remain. It will be all right, you\u2019ll see. We haven\u2019t lost the stories.\u201d He took me in his arms, as h e always did now. The bed was soft and warm. His skin was growing whiter and whiter, and his muscles seemed more visible than ever. His hair had grown out and hung down over his eyes. \u201cThe fla mes burned all night. So long that I thought the n ight itself might never end. And everyone stayed on to stare at the fire, even af ter they\u2019d burned all their books. The sound of burning paper filled the air, and yet, for some reason, I felt as though I were surrounded by total silence. As though my eardrums were frozen. This was the first time a disappearance seemed like a solemn ceremony. The old man and I just stood there holding hands, because it felt as though I would be sucked into the flames if someone didn\u2019t hold me back.\u201d I told R every detail of what had happened that night. Once I opened my mouth, things came tumbling out one after the other and I couldn\u2019t stop myself. The difficulty we\u2019d had pulling the cart, the red glow on the playgro und equipment in the park, the hat that ha d fallen in the mud, the ruined library, the bird \u2026But no matter how long I talked, I couldn\u2019t help feeling that I was leaving out the most important thing\u2014whatever that was. He listened attentively to every word. When a t last I grew tired of t alking, I heaved a deep sigh and looked up. He seemed to be staring far into the distance. Behind him I could se e the empty plate that had held his dinner , with a single p ea remaining in the middle. The books that had escaped the flames were neatly arranged on the shelf above.\u201cI supp ose a great deal has ch anged in the outside world since I\u2019ve bee n here, \u201d he said as he gently stroked my hair. I could feel his voice filling the space between our bodies. \u201cDoes my hair have an odd smell?\u201d I asked him. \u201cOdd how?\u201d \u201cLike spices.\u201d \u201cNo, it has a wonderful smell, like shampoo.\u201d He ran his fingers through it. \u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d I murmured. Then h e read aloud my story about the typist. To me, it sounded like a fairy tale from a distant land. . . . \u201cDoes it tire y ou out to be doing something you\u2019re not u sed to?\u201d ask ed the old man as he arranged the teapot and cups on the table. H e was wearing the sweater I had given him over a thick shirt, with wool slippers on his feet. \u201cNo, everyone is very nice to me,\u201d I told him, \u201cand I\u2019m enjoying the work.\u201d We were meeting for tea on the boat for the first time in a while. W hat\u2019s more, we were having pancakes. I had found eggs and honey, both great rarities, and we cooked together. We divided the batter in thirds and made three cakes, one of w hich I\u2019d wrapped in a napkin to take to R. Don, who had been dozing un der the sofa, must have sme lled the pan cakes, since he appeared suddenly and began to nudge the tablecloth with his muzzle. \u201cTyping is hard, but I enjoy practicing. As soon as your fing ers start to move, a sentence appears almost effortlessly\u2014it\u2019s like magic.\u201d The old man poured the honey over the pancakes, careful not to waste a single drop. \u201cAnd the business seems to b e going well. Herbs grow in the least bit of soil, and you can h arvest them even with all th is snow. Food is so hard to get that people are selling half-rotten meat and vegetables, and everyone wants something fragrant to kill the smell\u2014so my coworkers are expecting big bonuses.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d said the old m an as he lifted the lid on the pot to see whether the tea had finished steeping. We chatted about this and that as we sipped our tea, laug hed at D on\u2019s antics, and slowly at e the pancakes. Cutting just one bite at a time, we l et it dissolve on our tongues in order to ap preciate every bit of the sweetness, and as the remaining pieces of pancake grew smaller, so did the size of the bites we cut. We eac h gave a bite to Don, who inhaled them with no thought for their sweet fla vor and then stood looking at us expectantly, as though unwilling to believe that there was nothing more. Light p oured in through the windows, bright enough to m ake you think spring might be j ust around the corner. The sea was calm, an d the boat, which was usually creaking as it rocked on the waves, was quiet. The great pile of snow melting on the dock shone in the sunlight. When we\u2019d finished eating, the old man went to find the music b ox hidd en in the bathroom. He set it on the table and we listened togeth er. As always, it faithfully repeated its tu ne, over and ove r. We stopped chatting, sat up straight, and closed our eyes. I had no idea where or how one was supposed to lis ten to a music box, but I had decid ed arbitrarily that closing my eyes would enhance the effect R had hoped it would induce in us. The melody that flowed from the box was simple but pure and sweet. That much I could feel. But I had no confidence that it would be able to check the exhaustion that was overtaking my soul. Because once it had been sucked beneath the surfac e of that bottomless swamp, it left no trace at all, no ripple, no fleck of foam. Don, to o, eyed the music bo x with some interest. Each time we w ould rewind the mechan ism and the music would sta rt again, his e ars would twitch and he would back away, belly pressed to the floor. It seemed as though he was barely able to con tain his curiosity, but when I picked it up and held it in front of h is nose, he ran for cover between the old man\u2019s legs. \u201cHow has your\u2026novel been going?\u201d he asked, after finally closing the lid of the music box. Even pronouncing the word hadapparently become difficult for him. \u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d I told him, \u201cbut it\u2019s not going very well.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s difficult when something has disappeared. To tell the truth, I feel a kind of emptiness every time I wind the spring on this box. I try to tell myse lf that this time I might discover something new, but I\u2019m always disappointed. Still, it\u2019s a precious present so I force myself to wind it up again.\u201d \u201cI know. I put a fresh sheet of paper on my desk, but no matter how long I stare at it nothing comes to me. I don\u2019t know where I am or where I want to go\u2026as though I\u2019m lost in a thick fog. Then I tel l myself I\u2019ll fin d a way around it and I turn to my machine and just start typing . I have a typewriter I borrowed from work o n my desk. They are beautiful things, when you look at them. C omplex yet delicate, quite lovely. Just like a musical instrument. W hich is why I listen for the sound the levers make as they move the keys, hoping f or something that will connect to my novel\u2026but nothing seems to help.\u201d \u201cThose terrible flames would paralyze anyone\u2014it seemed like the whole island was burning\u2026\u201d \u201cI thoug ht I could hear the so und of my memory burning that night.\u201d Don gav e a little yawn. We ha dn\u2019t realized it, but he had been moving a bit at a time to keep himself in the warm rays of the sun. We could hear the voices of children in the distance; no doubt they we re delighted by the first nice day in a long time. Some men in w ork clothes were playing catch in front of the warehouse on the dock. \u201cStill\u2026,\u201d I continued, \u201cwhy do you suppose I thought of writing a story about a typist? I\u2019d barely ever used a typew riter or had any friends who were typists. It\u2019s strange.\u201d \u201cIs it possible to write abou t something in a novel eve n if you\u2019ve never experienced it?\u201d The old man looked a bit skeptical. \u201cI s uppose it is. Even if you haven\u2019t seen or heard about something, it seems you ca n just imagine it and then write it down. It doesn\u2019t have to be exactly like the real thing; it\u2019s apparently all right to make things up or even lie. At lea st that\u2019s what R says.\u201d\u201cEven lie?\u201d The old man man\u2019s eyebrow s twitched, as though he was growing more and more confused. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Apparently no one blames you for lying in a novel. You can make up the story out of nothing, starti ng from zero. Yo u write about something you can\u2019t see as though you can see it. You ma ke up something that doesn\u2019t exist just b y using words. That\u2019s why R says we shouldn\u2019t give up, even if our memories disappear.\u201d I tappe d my fork on my empty plate. Don seemed to be dozing, his head resting on h is front paws. Their break over, the men who had been playing catch walked back toward the warehouse, their gloves dangling in their hands. \u201cI\u2019m no t sure whether I shou ld be asking this,\u201d the old man said after staring at the sea for a moment. \u201cBut you\u2019re in lo ve with him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Unsure how to answer, I reached down and put my arms around Don\u2019s neck. The dog\u2019s eyes opened with annoyance, and he let out a sound , half cough and half burp. Then he slipped out of my embrace, ran once aroun d the cabin, and came back to the same sunny spot. \u201cI supp ose,\u201d I said, my tone intentionally ambiguous. \u201cBut do you thin k he\u2019ll ever be able to come out of hiding? Do you think he\u2019ll be able to see his wife and child again? I doubt it. I th ink he\u2019ll be able to live only in the hid den room. His soul is too dense. If he comes o ut, he\u2019 ll dissolve into pieces, like a deep-sea fish pulled to the surf ace too quickly. I suppose my job is to go on holding him here at the bottom of the sea.\u201d \u201cI understand,\u201d the old man said, nodding, his eyes staring at his hands. Don, apparentl y hoping to nap a bit more, rubbed his paws on his jaw and then stretched out with a satisfied air. Just the n, a terrible noise rumbled through the heavens. We hopped up instinctively and braced our hands on the table. Don jumped to his feet. The boat began to rock violently. The dresser, the dish cabinet, the radio, the lamp, the pendulum clock\u2014everything inthe cabin crashed down around us. \u201cEarthquake!\u201d the old man cried.When t he shaking stopped and I opened my eyes again, the first thing I saw amid the debris was Don, hiding under the couch,",

      "chapter_text": "In all likelihood he was telling me lies, unwill ing to hurt me further and deepen the dama ge done by the old man\u2019s death, but I didn\u2019t care. If he was willing to be kind to me, the reason didn\u2019t matter. Not a speck of dust floated on the water. I looked out on the grassy meadow. When the wind blew, it made patterns in the grass. Patterns like those in cheese nibbled by mice. Still wit hout feeling the sense of a story, I continued to put together strings of words, one line each night. The size and balance of my characters gradually improved, but my hand still shook when it came time to select a word. \u201cThat\u2019s wonde rful! You\u2019re doing fine.\u201d R took each piece of paper and added it to the pile.. . . The firs t disapp earance since the death of the old man. I lay in bed collecting my wits, trying to determine the nature of the thing that no longer existed. It was quiet outside, no sign that the neighbors were stirring. Which might mean that it was so mething relatively insig nificant. I tried to get up, but I felt as though dense air h ad coiled around my bod y. Weak sunlight filtered in through the curtains, promising a gray day. Perhaps another heavy snowfall. I should get out of the house early and catch the seven o\u2019clock tram. There were always delays on the day of a disappearance. I p ulled back the quilt an d made a bizarre discovery\u2014 something was stuck fast to my hip. And no matter how much I pulled or pushed or twisted, it would not come off, just as though it had been welded to me. \u201cWhat in the world?\u201d I s aid, gripping the pillow with frustration. I had the feeling I would fall out of the bed if I didn\u2019t hold on to so mething. At the slightest movement, the thing attached to my hips threw my body off balance. I he ld s till, my face against the pillow, trying to calm myse lf. A chilly sensatio n lingered in my hands from where I\u2019d touched whatever it was that was attached to me a moment earlier. Had I come down with some sort of disease? Perhaps an enormous tumor had developed overnig ht? How could I get to the hospital with th is sort of affliction? I glanced down again at my body, which was still stretched out in the same position on the bed. Since I couldn\u2019t remain wher e I was indefinitely, I decide d to get up and get dressed. First, I put my weight on my right leg and slowly sat up. But as I did, the thing fell with a heavy thu d and I was thr own to the floor. I fell against the wastebasket, knocking it over and spilling the contents, but I managed to crawl to the dresser and pull out a sweater and some pants. The sweater went on easily. The problem was the pants, which seemed to have two openings. Once I\u2019d slid my right leg into one of th em, I had no idea what to do with the other. The thing was still the re on my hip, as though it were looking at me, waiting for something. I wasn\u2019t exactly afraid of it, but it did seem so mehowrather o minous. But the more I studied it, the more I reali zed that it had a shape that would exactly fit the other opening in my pants. The righ t lengt h, the right thi ckness, it was perfect. I tried taking it in both hands and putting it into the opening. It was heavy and difficult to work with, but after some time, just as I\u2019d ima gined, it slid neatly into the pants. As though someone had measured it in advance. It was then I finally realized what had disappeared: my left leg. I h ad trouble g etting down the stairs without falling. Hold ing on t o the railin g, I had to drag the thing\u2014my disappeared leg\u2014one step at a time. Outside, the snow piled up on the groun d made things even more difficult. F ortunately, however, after hesitating for a moment, I had decided to put a shoe on my left foot as well. The neighbors were gradually beginning to gather in the street outside. They all seemed to b e wondering how to deal with their own bo dies, as though fearful that the least motion would cause them pain. Some walked ho lding on to walls or fences , others moved in family groups, using one another\u2019s shoulders for support, and some, like the former hatmaker, were using umbrellas or other objects as crutches. \u201cHow can this be happening?\u201d murmured someone, and there were nods of ag reement. It was the first disappearance of t his sort, and we were at a loss, unable to imagine what might happen next. \u201cA lot of unexpected things have disappeared, but never anything as shocking as this,\u201d said the woman who lived across the street. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to us?\u201d \u201cNothing at all. That\u2019s the point. It\u2019s just one more cavity that has opened up on the island. How is it any different f rom the others?\u201d said the old man in the house next to mine who worked at city hall. \u201cBut something isn\u2019t right about this. My body feels as though it\u2019s gone to pieces and won\u2019t go back together again.\u201d This time it was the hatmaker, who was d igging in the snow with the tip of his umbrella. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it. It may be a bit tricky at first, but th at\u2019s been true for other disappea rances as well. It takes time to getaccustomed, but there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201d \u201cI guess I\u2019m actually lucky,\u201d laughed the old woman who lived two ho uses down the street. \u201cHalf the arthritis in my knees is gone!\u201d I could manage no more than a faint smile. As we talked, from time to t ime each of us glanced down at our left leg. Would the cold creeping up from the snow bring feeling back to it? Perhaps this was all a mistake\u2026Or so the vaguely hopeful expressions on our faces seemed to suggest. \u201cI wonder,\u201d I said, screwing up the courage to ask the question that had been on my mind for some time. \u201cHow can we get rid of them?\u201d The ma n from the mayor\u2019s o ffice let out a low moan, the old woman with knee trouble sniffed, and the woman across the street spun th e hand le of her umbr ella. But no one said anythi ng for a moment. Perhaps they were considering the problem, or perhaps they were simply waiting for someone else to say something. At that moment we saw three members of the Memory Police come to ward u s from the oth er end of the street. We moved closer together on the sidewalk to get out of their way. What wo uld they do if they found us here, still in possession of our legs? They were out on patrol, dres sed in their usual uniforms. The first thi ng I did was look at their left legs. I could see they were intact, so I fel t somewhat relieved. If the Memory Police didn\u2019t know h ow to get rid of their legs, they could hardly blame us for still having ours. But they were walking with their usual even gait, perfectly in balance, as though the disappearance had caused them n o difficulty\u2014as though they had been training for just this eventuality. When they had passed by and we were sure they were out of sight, the hatmaker spoke up. \u201cI suppose there\u2019s no need for us to get rid of our legs, then.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right. No need to get out the saw just yet\u2026\u201d \u201cBurning, bury ing, washing away, abandoning\u2014I guess for some things, there\u2019s just no appropriate way.\u201d \u201cThough I imagine they\u2019ll come up with one soon enough.\u201d\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll just fall off by themselves, like leaves fro m a tree.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right.\u201d \u201cSo there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d When we\u2019d all had our say, we made our way home\u2014though we w ere less su re-footed than the Memory Police. The old woman fell by her gate, and the hatmaker\u2019s umbrella got stuck in a snowbank. Don ha d come out of his house and was pacing in front of the door, wagging his tail nervously. When he saw me, he came running, kicking up snow and snorting with pleasure, but as he approached I realized that his back left leg had disappeared. \u201cYou too, boy? Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be all right.\u201d I wrapped my arms around him. His hind leg dangled limply. . . . That night in bed, R massaged my disappeared leg. He worked at it for a long time, as though he thought his effor ts might bring it back. \u201cWhen I was a little girl and had a fever, my mother would rub me like this,\u201d I murmured. \u201cYou see?\u201d he said. \u201cHow can your leg have disappeared when you still have a memory like that?\u201d He smiled and pressed harder with his hand. \u201cI su ppose so,\u201d I said, noddin g vaguely and looking up at the ceiling. In fact, the feelings I remembered from my mother\u2019s h and and those from R\u2019s now were completely different. No warmth, no sensation at all came to my leg from his touch. Just the uncomfortable feeling of one thing grating against another. But I worried that it would hurt him if I told him the truth. \u201cLook,\u201d he said. \u201cHere you have five toenails lined up neat as you please. Smooth and translucent like the skin of a fruit. And here\u2019s t he heel, and the ankle. All the same as your right leg. And the lovely curve of your knee fits perfectly in the palm of my hand. You can feel th e intricate bone structure. Your thigh is am azinglywhite, your calf is soft and warm. I can feel every part of your leg, each sc ratch an d bruise and bump. How can you say all that has disappeared?\u201d He knelt at the edge of the bed, his hands continuing to move. I closed my eyes, more conscious than ever of the new cavity that had opened up in my body. It was filled to the brim with clear water th at retained no trace of any memory. R\u2019s hand stirred the water, but no m ore than a few tiny bubbles rose to the surface and popped silently. \u201cI\u2019m ha ppy you\u2019re here,\u201d I told him. \u201cHappy to know you\u2019ll go on look ing afte r my leg even though it\u2019s gone. The other legs on the island must feel sad and abandoned.\u201d \u201cI ca n\u2019t imagine what it must be like in the outside world, with things disappearing one after the other\u2026\u201d \u201cI d oubt the changes seem as great to us as they would to y ou. We shru g them off with as little fuss as possible and make do with what\u2019s left. Just as we alway s have. Though this time people do seem a bit mo re concerned. Maybe because we haven\u2019t been able to disp ose of the thing tha t\u2019s disappeared and have to keep carrying it around with us. Though I\u2019m already getting used to that, thanks to you.\u201d \u201cYou go to great lengths to get rid of these things, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cI su ppose we d o. But this tim e there\u2019s nothing to be done. We can\u2019t bu rn them or crush them or throw them in the sea. We just try to avoid them as much as possible. But I\u2019m sure that w ill pass soon enough. I don\u2019t know ho w, but sooner or later everything will fall back into place.\u201d \u201cFall back into place? What do you mean?\u201d \u201cEventually, the hole left by our legs will find a place in our hearts and minds that fits it perfectly, a place to fall into.\u201d \u201cBut wh y woul d you do that? Why would you want to get rid of these things? I need your leg as much as I need the rest of you\u2026\u201d He closed his eyes and sighed. I started to reach out to touch h is face but then froze when my leg threated to slip o ff of the bed. He took it in his hands a nd brought it to his mouth, kissing it on the calf. A quiet kiss that was almost like a whisper.I t houg ht how wonderful it w ould be had I been able to feel his l ips, to sens e them on skin and flesh that had not disappeared. But on my left leg there was only a slight pressure, like th e weight of a bit of modeling clay. \u201cStay a bit longer, like that,\u201d I told him. Though the feeling was empty, I wanted to watch him holding on to that void. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as you like.\u201dGradually we became accustomed to living without our legs. Needless to say, things did n ot go back to the way they h ad been before, not exactly, but ou r bodies acquired a new s ense of balance, and a new kind of d aily rhythm took hold. Eventually we stopped noticing people who were unable to stand without holding on t o so mething, or who were too tense to walk naturally, or who fell at random moments. We learned to control our bodies without too much inconvenience. Even Don began running around again at full speed. He would jump up on the roof of his house to bask in the sun or leap at the branche s of trees in the yard to bring the snow t umbling down. From time to time he proved too successful at this game and wo uld come running to me for help after an enormous lump of sn ow had fallen on his head. But once I had wiped his face and rubbed his chin, he went right back to the tree, aiming t his time for even heavier branches. No m atter how much time went by, there was no sign that our left legs were going to rot an d drop off. They remained f irmly in place, fixed to our hips. But no one seemed to care. The nu mber of people who w ere taken away by the Memory Police suddenl y increased. Those who had used all sorts of tricks in t he past to blend in could no longer fool the police after the disappearance of their left legs. It was surprising to see how many people had managed to hide in plain sight without being c aptured or resorting to safe houses, but now they found it impossible to imitate our new sense of balance. No matter how much they tried, something was slightly different about the distribution of the weight or the alignment of t he muscles or the movement of the joints. And the Memory Police could spot it immediately.This crackdow n, and the loss of the old man, meant that our communication with R\u2019s wife had now been suspended for some time. Th ere was always the fear that the phones were tapped, and sending me for a face-to-face meeting seemed still riskier. Letters and packages from his wife were R\u2019s only ties to his former life, but receiving them was dang erous, and the best way to keep him safe was to kee p him completely isolated. Still, at some point we decided we could use the telephone to communicat e if we managed to settle on a code. We decided that we would let the phone ring three times at a pr edetermined hour before han ging up \u2014the signal that R was healt hy and doing well. Three rings from the other end meant the message had been received and understood. But in order to set up this system, I needed to go back to the elementary school for the first time in a long while. When I did, I discovered tha t the meteorological box was no longer mounted on its post . I found it in pieces on the ground, perhaps destroyed in the earthquake or crushed under the weight of the snow. I could see the thermometer, shattered and half covered by a pile of boards. I hesitated, wondering what to do, but in the end I decided to p ush the le tter in among the remains of the box. T his tiny meteorological station had lo ng ago been forgotten, and now that it was in ruins, it was even less likely to attract attention\u2014making it all the mor e ideal for our purposes. My one concern was whether R\u2019s wife was still coming to look for letters here. Still, at the appointed hour, I dialed the number and let it ring three times before hanging up. Then I waited in fron t of the phone. After a moment, it began to ring. Three rings that seemed to d issolve into the shadows and then silence. I had the feeling that the receiver had been trembling. . . . I contin ued with the task o f writing strings of words that made almost no sense. The f eeling of purpose I\u2019d had during my time as a novelist was gone, but compared to the emptiness I\u2019d felt after the burning of the librar y, things were going more sm oothly. At any rate, I\u2019d gotten to th e point where the shapes of certainwords s eemed to be returning. I could vaguely recall the fingers of the typist locked away in t he clock tower, the pattern of the parquet floor, the mountain of typewriters, the sound of f ootsteps coming up the stairs. Still, it was ex tremely difficult to",

      "chapter_text": "fill the boxes on the bl ank manuscript paper with characters, and the number of words I produced for an entire night\u2019s effort was painfully small. A t times I grew so weary and frustrated that I wanted to throw the stack of paper out the w indow, but then I would choose one of the objects I had bor rowed from the hidden room, set it on my open pal ms, and breathe deeply to calm myself. Little b y little, the boat slipp ed lower. When I took Don out for a walk, I st opped at the ru ins of the library to sit and gaze out at the sea. It was lonely but peaceful there, with the sound of cars on t he coastal road barely au dible in the distance. The rumor had continued to spread that they were planning to build a headquarters for the Memory Police on the site, but the piles of burned bricks had not been removed and there was no sign that construction would be starting anytime soon. \u201cDo you remember how th e old man looked sitting right here?\u201d I asked Don. \u201cI never imagined that would be the l ast time I\u2019d s ee him.\u201d D on galloped about, clearly unconcerned wit h what I was telling him. \u201cI should hav e noticed something was wrong that day. Bu t he looked fine, his usual self. Though I suppose he did seem a bit sad, and he was n ever willing to ask for help. I wish I could put my arms around him and tell him there\u2019s no thing to fear, that everything will be all right\u2014the way he always did for me. But he\u2019s gone, Don.\u201d I too k a cracke r from my pock et, broke it in pieces, and tossed them to Don. He jumped a nd twisted, deftly catching them in midair, and as I clapped m y approval he raised his n ose and capered about, begging for more. \u201cIf I\u2019d realized sooner what was happening, we might h ave saved him.\u201d I tried to put into words the regret that lingered in my head, though I knew that saying this aloud might only make things worse. Don noisily chewed his cracker.Now, w hen the waves were h igh, they hid the last bit of the boat still visible. And it seem ed clear that it would soon vanish entirely beneat h the surface. My heart ached when I thoug ht about that day. Would I rememb er how we had eaten cake in the wheelhouse? Or made our plans to build the hidden room? Or stood o n deck, leaning against the rail, watching the sunse t? It was more than my empty heart could stand. . . . By the time their right arm s disappeared, people were less troubled than they had been with the disappearance of t heir left legs. They didn\u2019t linger in be d, wondering what had happened, or spend l ong hou rs trying to fig ure out how to get dressed, or worry about how to d ispose of the disappeared item. To be honest, we had been certain something like this would happen sooner or later. The disappearances of body parts were, in fact, easier and more p eaceful than earlier ones, as no one had to gather in the square to burn the objects o r send them floating down the river. There w as no uproar, no co nfusion. We merely went about our usual m orning routines, accep ting that a new cavity had opened in our lives. Of course, this disappearance brought subtle changes to my daily routine. I could no long er apply polish to my nails. I had to come up with a new way to t ype using only my left hand . It took inordinate amounts of time to peel vegetables. I had to move the rings I had worn on my right hand to my left\u2026But none of this posed any real problem. I had only to surrender to ea ch new disappearance to find myself carried along quite naturally to the place I needed to be. I wa s no longe r able to carry a tray of food and climb down the ladder to the hidden roo m. I would hand the tray carefully down to R and then descend the rungs, one by one, leaning on him for support. Nor was climbing back up any easier, as I struggled with the ladder and the trapdoor before pulling myself through the narrow entran ce. As I did, R would watch me from below with a worried look.\u201cThe tim e will come when I w on\u2019t be able to get in and ou t of this room,\u201d I told him. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. I\u2019ll just pick you up and carry you, lik e a princess,\u201d he said, holding out his arms toward me. They still seemed surprisingly strong, though they\u2019d had no more taxing exercise than organizing receipts, shelling peas, or polishing silver. They were supple and alive, u nlike my right arm, which se emed to have hardened like plaster. \u201cThat w ould be wonderful,\u201d I said. \u201cBut how can you h old something that has disappeared?\u201d His han ds dro pped to his kn ees and he looked up at me and blinked as though he hadn\u2019t grasped the meaning of my question. \u201cI can hold you, I can touch any part of you I want.\u201d \u201cYou can touch me, but what does it mean if I don\u2019t feel anything?\u201d \u201cWhat d o you mean? Look, w hat about here? And here?\u2026\u201d As he spoke, he took hold of the limp rods that hung from my shoulder and hip. The hem of my skirt swayed. My hair fell across my face. \u201cYes, I know y ou take good care of my body. And I know you can summon up memories o f the music box and the ferry ticket, the harmonica or the ramune. But that doesn\u2019t mean the things themselves come back. It\u2019s no more than a momentary flash, like the tip of a spa rkler when you light it in the dark. When the light\u2019s gone, it \u2019s insta ntly forgotten , and you can scarcely belie ve what you saw just a moment ago. They\u2019re all illusions\u2014my leg a nd arm and all the rest of the things lined up on the shelves.\u201d I loo ked around at the objec ts in the room and then tucked my hair behind my ears. R let go of my arm and leg, and I scuffed my foot in and out of my slipper. The traces of his finger s on my ankle and calf vanished alm ost immediately as they reverted to their plaster state. \u201cMy bo dy will go on disappe aring bit by bit,\u201d I said, shifting my gaze from my toes to my knees, from my hips to my chest. \u201cNo, you mustn\u2019t say that.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I say, the disappearances will continue. Ther e\u2019s no escape. I wonder what will be nex t. Ears? Throat? Eyebrows? My other arm or leg? Or maybe my spine? And then what will be left? Or will nothing be left at all? I suppose that\u2019s it, every last bit of me will disappear.\u201d \u201cNo, th at\u2019s imp ossible. Aren\u2019 t we here together, right now , in spite of everything?\u201d He put his hand on my shoulder and drew me to him. \u201cBut the arm and leg you se e aren\u2019t really mine. No ma tter how mu ch you care for them, they\u2019re just shells, empty skin. The real me is disappearing as we speak. Slowly but surely being sucked into thin air.\u201d \u201cBut I won\u2019t let you go.\u201d \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to go. I want to stay with you, but that won\u2019t be p ossible. Your heart and mine are being pulled apart to such different, distant places. Yours is overflowing with warmth and life and sounds and smells, but mine is growing cold and hard at a terrifying pace . At some point it will break into a thousand pieces, shards of ice that will dissolve.\u201d \u201cBut yo u don\u2019t have to go,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just have to stay here. Y ou\u2019ll be safe here, where all the lost memories are preserved, hidden along with the emerald and the perfume, the photographs and the calendars\u2026\u201d \u201cMe?\u2026Here?\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s impossible,\u201d I said, shaking my head in confusion at this unexpected idea. My arm slipped from the bed and struck his knee. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t. W e\u2019re protected here\u2014you, me, all the things that were hidden in the sculptures. Even the Memory Police haven\u2019t been able to find us.\u201d \u201cBut I know th e end is coming. The disappearances used to happen suddenly, without warning, but I had premonitions before my leg and arm disappeared . I could feel my skin stiffening and growing numb . So I can tell something is going to disappear. It may be a few days from now or a few weeks, but it will com e. AndI\u2019m frightened . Not because I\u2019ll disappear and cease to e xist, but because I\u2019ll have to leave you. The thought terrifies me.\u201d \u201cYou mustn\u2019t be afraid,\u201d he s aid, laying me down on the b ed. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe, here in my secret room.\u201dSometimes it strikes me as strange that I don\u2019t hate him more. I should curse him and beat him, \ufb01nd any way I can to do him harm, though I know it would do no good. After all, he deceived me, stole my voice, and shut me up in this place. But for all that, I don\u2019t really hate him. In fact, when he shows me the occasional kindness, I even feel a certain a\ufb00ection for him: when he turns the handle of my spoon to make it easier to pick up, or wipes away soap bubbles that threaten to get into my eyes, or untangles my hair from a zipper as I\u2019m changing my clothes. Compared to the truly horrible things he has done, these are tri\ufb02es barely worth mentioning. And yet, when I see his \ufb01ngers working just for my bene\ufb01t, I can\u2019t help feeling a kind of gratitude. I know it\u2019s foolish, but that\u2019s my honest reaction and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. Perhaps these feelings are proof that I\u2019m becoming more and more attached to this room. Things I felt in the outside world have faded away here, transformed into emotions more suited to this place. I \ufb01nd, too, that my eyesight has recently started to fail. The mountain of typewriters, the bed, the bell, the various items in the drawer of the desk\u2014all of it appears only dimly, as though shrouded in a dark veil. As does the outside world, glimpsed through the crack by the clock. Even on a bright and sunny afternoon, the grass in the church garden seems gray and hazy, the people gathered there indistinguishable from the shadows.As a result, I\u2019m forced to move with added care no matter what I\u2019m doing\u2014even things as simple as washing my face or changing my clothes. I \ufb01nd I\u2019m constantly tripping over the tools used to care for the clock or bumping into the chair. I\u2019m particularly tense when he\u2019s here. Not that he gets angry when I show my clumsiness. But by the same token he never helps me, content always to watch in silence with that peculiar smile on his face. A cold smile, like the stroke of an icy brush down my side. Though my eyes get progressively weaker, for some reason I can always see him with great clarity. I can see every movement his \ufb01ngers make, while everything else is dim and vague. One day, something unusual happened. Not long after he had gone down to teach a class of beginners, I heard the sound of footsteps coming up the tower stairs. They were slower and more deliberate than his, and they seemed to stop on one of the landings below, as if hesitating, before starting up again. I wonder who this could be. Do they intend to come all the way up here? I had no idea what to do. Was this person a friend or an enemy? What sort of relationship did she\u2014for the sound of the footsteps made me certain it was a woman \u2014have to my captor? Did she know about me? In just a few seconds, these questions ran through my head, throwing me into a state of confusion. I realized that in all this time no one but he had entered this room. Nor had it ever once occurred to me, while I was a student, that I might want to ascend to the top of the tower. From the sound of the footsteps I was sure not only that the person approaching was a woman but that she was young. The tapping on the wooden stairs, like the pecking of a bird\u2019s beak, suggested that she was wearing high heels.Her footsteps seemed to convey her hesitation, as though she was fearful of what she might \ufb01nd at the top of this endless staircase. As she approached the clock room, the interval between each step lengthened. Perhaps she was weary, rather than confused or afraid, since the stairway to the clock tower was narrow and steep and terribly long. In any case, she had at last reached the door. She knocked three times. I was sitting on the \ufb02oor, my arms wrapped around my knees. I had never noticed the clear, dry sound of the old wooden door, since he never knocked but made his appearance after a great rattling of the keys on his ring. I realized this might be my best chance to escape. A student in the typing class had come all the way up here, perhaps having heard suspicious noises or perhaps out of simple curiosity. Even though I couldn\u2019t call out, I could run to the door and knock on it to let her know of my existence. Then, surely, she would go and \ufb01nd help in the church or call the police. She would force the lock or take some other action to rescue me. And I would rejoin the outside world. But I remained crouched on the \ufb02oor, unable to move a muscle. My heart was pounding, my lips trembling. Sweat beaded on my forehead. Hurry now! If you aren\u2019t quick she\u2019ll go away! In my head I screamed these words to myself. But something held me back. No! Keep still! How can you explain this to her? Would she believe you? And how would you even tell her? It\u2019s not just words you lack. Your eyes and ears, every part of your body has been deformed to \ufb01t this room\u2014that is, to \ufb01t his purposes. And even if she did help you, do you really believe you\u2019d get back all the things you\u2019ve lost? Covering my ears with both hands, I hid my face in my lap, held my breath, and prayed the girl would giveup and go back down the stairs. I knew now that I lacked the courage to rejoin the outside world. I\u2019m not sure how long I stayed that way. She jiggled the lock and turned the handle, and then, with a sigh, she moved away from the door. The echoes of her footsteps receded, spiraling down the staircase. I was still unable to move, even after they had long since vanished altogether, frozen by the fear that the slightest noise would bring her running back up the stairs. It was not until evening that I found myself wanting to peek out from behind the clock and look down on the churchyard. Needless to say I was unable to pick out the woman who had knocked on my door. In the garden below, the students leaving the afternoon classes mingled with those arriving for the evening. But they were no more than shadowy masses, my weakened eyes unable to distinguish their features or clothing or shoes. The only thing that was clearly visible\u2014indeed painfully etched on my retinas\u2014was his form as he sat on a bench, chatting pleasantly with his students. That night, he appeared, bringing with him more strange articles of clothing, though these were not as elaborate or re\ufb01ned as the earlier ones had been. Like the other garments, these were not the kind of things being worn in the outside world, but the fabrics were more ordinary than usual, there were no decorations of any kind, and the stitching was crude. I found myself feeling disappointed. \u201cDid someone pay you a visit today?\u201d he asked abruptly. Startled, I dropped the clothes he had just handed to me. How did he know about the woman who had come to the door? If he did know, why hadn\u2019t he stopped her? Why risk revealing such an important secret?\u2026Confused, I looked down at the \ufb02oor. \u201cDid someone knock at the door?\u201d he asked. I gave a slight nod. \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you ask her for help?\u201d he added as he began gathering up the clothes I haddropped. \u201cYou might have found lots of ways to alert her that you\u2019re here. You could have knocked back, or dragged a chair across the \ufb02oor, thrown a typewriter against the wall.\u201d I stood still, unsure how to reply. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you run away? She could have helped you get out of here, and you would have been free by now.\u201d He reached up to touch my cheek before continuing. \u201cBut you did nothing. You stayed here. Why?\u201d He continued pressing me for a reason, though he knew that I was incapable of providing one. So what was he really seeking? I stood frozen to the spot. \u201cShe\u2019s a new student at the beginner level,\u201d he said, the stream of questions \ufb01nally coming to an end. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t much technique yet, and I don\u2019t even have her typing complete sentences. She just taps out single words, and even then she makes mistakes. But she came to",
