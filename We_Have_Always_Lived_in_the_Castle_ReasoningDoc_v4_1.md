## 1. Alignment Pattern

**Pattern**: Deceptive Intimacy

**Core Dynamic**: First-person limited narration creates false closeness while dramatic irony and unreliability systematically undermine reader trust and understanding.

**Reader Effect**: The reader experiences increasing discomfort as intimate access to Merricat's consciousness reveals her fundamental disconnect from reality and moral reasoning.

## 2. Macro Variable Justifications

**Narrative Voice**: FP provides direct access to Merricat's thoughts, creating initial reader sympathy. INT focalization limits understanding to her skewed perspective. UNREL gradually reveals her distorted worldview. RETRO temporal distance suggests reflection but reveals only rationalization. NONE intrusion maintains the illusion of unmediated access to her mind.

**Narrative Structure**: LIN chronology follows the family's inexorable path to destruction. MONO architecture centers everything on the Blackwood isolation. SLOW pacing mirrors the suffocating atmosphere of the house. AB_OVO beginning drops readers into an already-established pattern of dysfunction. CLOSED ending seals the characters in their chosen isolation.

**Rhetorical Voice**: SUBJ stance reflects Merricat's self-centered worldview. Dark fairy tale tone masks genuine horror with whimsical language. COLL register creates false accessibility. DRAM irony emerges as readers understand what Merricat cannot or will not acknowledge. STRONG pathos manipulates reader emotions through Merricat's seeming vulnerability.

**Rhetorical Structure**: TRANS alignment gradually shifts reader sympathy from protectiveness to horror. TIGHT N-R relationship maintains narrative focus on character revelation. CHAR mechanism drives discovery through personality exposure. ACCUMULATION mediation builds understanding through gathered details rather than direct statements.

## 3. Device Selections by Freytag Section

**Exposition**: Metaphor, Simile, and Motif establish Merricat's magical thinking and the house's symbolic significance, creating the deceptive fairy tale atmosphere that masks underlying pathology.

**Rising Action**: The primary development occurs in Chapter 5, where devices would build tension around Cousin Charles's intrusion and Merricat's increasing desperation to maintain family isolation.

**Climax**: Foreshadowing, Symbolism, and Juxtaposition intensify the pattern in Chapter 7's fire sequence, where Merricat's magical thinking collides with destructive reality while maintaining her distorted perspective.

**Falling Action**: Dramatic Irony, Situational Irony, and Personification pivot the pattern in Chapter 8 as the fire's aftermath reveals the community's hatred while Merricat attributes agency to objects rather than acknowledging her own actions.

**Resolution**: Unreliable Narrator, Verbal Irony, and First-Person Narration complete the deceptive intimacy in Chapter 10, sealing readers into Merricat's final delusions of contentment while the full horror of the situation becomes clear.

## 4. Alignment Effect

This alignment creates a sophisticated psychological horror through the systematic corruption of narrative intimacy. The FP/INT combination initially positions readers as Merricat's confidants, while DRAM irony and UNREL gradually expose the chasm between her perceptions and reality. The CHAR mechanism through ACCUMULATION allows Jackson to reveal Merricat's true nature—as both victim and perpetrator—without breaking the TIGHT N-R relationship that maintains the claustrophobic focus. The TRANS alignment guides readers from sympathy through unease to horror, while the SUBJ stance and fairy tale tone create cognitive dissonance between Merricat's whimsical language and her destructive actions. This produces a uniquely unsettling reading experience where intimacy becomes complicity, forcing readers to confront their own capacity for rationalization and self-deception.
