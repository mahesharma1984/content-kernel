## 1. Alignment Pattern

**Pattern**: Innocent Revelation

**Core Dynamic**: First-person child narrator with retrospective distance creates dramatic irony where adult understanding illuminates moral truths through innocent observation.

**Reader Effect**: Readers experience dual consciousness - seeing through child's eyes while grasping adult implications, creating powerful moral awakening through accumulated understanding.

## 2. Macro Variable Justifications

**Narrative Voice**: The FP (first-person) POV anchors readers in Scout's limited child perspective, while INT (internal focalization) restricts understanding to her innocent viewpoint. REL (reliable narrator) ensures trustworthiness despite limited comprehension. RETRO (retrospective temporal distance) creates the crucial gap between child experience and adult narration, enabling the dual consciousness effect. SOME intrusion allows subtle adult wisdom to filter through without breaking the child's voice.

**Narrative Structure**: LIN (linear chronology) mirrors Scout's chronological learning process, essential for accumulated understanding. MONO (single plot architecture) maintains focus on Scout's moral education through the trial events. VAR (variable pacing) accelerates during key revelations while allowing reflection during quiet moments. AB_OVO (beginning from the start) establishes the retrospective framework immediately.

**Rhetorical Voice**: SUBJ (subjective stance) reflects Scout's personal moral journey rather than objective reporting. The innocent yet morally serious tone creates the fundamental tension between childlike observation and profound moral implications. COLL (colloquial register) maintains authenticity of child voice while remaining accessible. DRAM (dramatic irony) is the cornerstone device, as readers consistently understand more than Scout does.

**Rhetorical Structure**: TRANS (transformational alignment) tracks Scout's moral awakening throughout the narrative. TIGHT N-R relationship ensures Scout's development directly serves the novel's moral argument. CHAR (character mechanism) makes Scout's growth the primary vehicle for reader engagement. ACCUMULATION mediation builds understanding gradually through repeated innocent observations that gain moral weight over time.

## 3. Device Selections by Freytag Section

**Exposition**: Dramatic Irony, Flashback, Symbolism, Juxtaposition, Dialogue, First-Person Narration, Imagery, and Situational Irony establish the pattern by introducing Scout's innocent voice alongside adult retrospective understanding. The mockingbird symbolism and Boo Radley mystery create interpretive gaps that readers fill while Scout cannot, immediately activating the dual consciousness effect.

**Rising Action**: Dramatic Irony, Symbolism, Juxtaposition, First-Person Narration, Imagery, Foreshadowing, Dialogue, and Motif develop the pattern as Scout encounters increasingly complex moral situations. Foreshadowing plants clues about Tom Robinson's fate and Boo's true nature that readers recognize while Scout remains focused on surface events, deepening the revelatory gap.

**Climax**: Symbolism, Dramatic Irony, Juxtaposition, First-Person Narration, Imagery, Repetition, Dialogue, and Suspense intensify the pattern during the trial scenes. Scout's innocent courtroom observations contrast sharply with readers' understanding of racial injustice, creating maximum dramatic irony as the verdict approaches.

**Falling Action**: Dramatic Irony, Symbolism, Foreshadowing, Juxtaposition, Imagery, First-Person Narration, and Motif pivot the pattern as Scout begins connecting earlier observations to moral truths. The mockingbird motif resurfaces as Scout starts grasping its significance, narrowing the gap between child understanding and reader knowledge.

**Resolution**: Dramatic Irony, Symbolism, First-Person Narration, Situational Irony, Suspense, Imagery, Juxtaposition, and Understatement complete the pattern as Scout achieves moral revelation. Her final understanding of Boo Radley and Atticus's lessons aligns her perspective closer to readers', fulfilling the innocent revelation journey while maintaining the retrospective narrative frame.

## 4. Alignment Effect

This alignment creates a powerful moral pedagogy where readers experience enlightenment alongside but ahead of the protagonist. The RETRO temporal distance and DRAM irony establish a teaching dynamic where Scout's FP innocent observations become vehicles for adult moral understanding. As ACCUMULATION builds through each Freytag section, devices like Symbolism and Juxtaposition deepen the interpretive gaps while Foreshadowing and Repetition create recognition patterns that guide reader understanding. The TIGHT N-R relationship ensures that Scout's gradual awakening to moral complexity directly facilitates readers' own moral reckoning, making her CHAR-driven transformation the mechanism through which Lee's social criticism achieves maximum emotional and intellectual impact.
