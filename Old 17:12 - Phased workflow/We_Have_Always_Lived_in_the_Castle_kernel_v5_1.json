      "chapter_text": "it. \u201cA small leg of lamb,\u201d I said, \u201cmy Uncle Julian always fancies a roasted lamb in the first spring days.\u201d I should not have said it, I knew, and a little gasp went around the store like a scream. I could make them run like rabbits, I thought, if I said to them what I really wanted to, but they would only gather again outside and watch for me there. \u201cOnions,\u201d I said politely to Mr. Elbert, \u201ccoffee, bread, flour. Walnuts,\u201d I said, \u201cand sugar; we are very low on sugar.\u201d Somewhere behind me there was a little horrified laugh, and Mr. Elbert glanced past me, briefly, and then to the items he was arranging on the counter. In a minute Mrs. Elbert would bring my chicken and my meat, wrapped, and set them down by the other things; I need not turn around until I was ready to go. \u201cTwo quarts of milk,\u201d I said. \u201cA half pint of cream, a pound of butter.\u201d The Harrises had stopped delivering dairy goods to us six years ago and I brought milk and butter home from the grocery now. \u201cAnd a dozen eggs.\u201d Constance had forgotten to put eggs on the list, but there had been only two at home. \u201cA box of peanut brittle,\u201d I said; Uncle Julian would clatter and crunch over his papers tonight, and go to bed sticky. \u201cThe Blackwoods always did set a fine table.\u201d That was Mrs. Donell, speaking clearly from somewhere behind me, and someone giggled and someone else said \u201cShh.\u201d I never turned; it was enough to feel them all there in back of me without looking into their flat grey faces with the hating eyes. I wish you were all dead, I thought, and longed to say it out loud. Constance said, \u201cNever let them see that you care,\u201d and \u201cIf you pay any attention they\u2019ll only get worse,\u201d and probably it was true, but I wished they were dead. I would have liked to come into the grocery some morning and see them all, even the Elberts and the children, lying there crying with the pain and dying. I would then help myself to groceries, I thought, stepping over their bodies, taking whatever I fancied from the shelves, and go home, with perhaps a kick for Mrs. Donell while she lay there. I was never sorry when I had thoughts like this; I only wished they would come true. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong to hate them,\u201d Constance said, \u201cit only weakens you, \u201d but I hated them anyway, and wondered why it had been worth while creating them in the first place. Mr. Elbert put all my groceries together on the counter and waited, looking past me into the distance. \u201cThat\u2019s all I want today,\u201d I told him, and without looking at me he wrote the prices on a slip and added,then passed the slip to me so I could make sure he had not cheated me. I always made a point of checking his figures carefully, although he never made a mistake; there were not many things I could do to get back at them, but I did what I could. The groceries filled my shopping bag and another bag besides, but there was no way of getting them home except by carrying them. No one would ever offer to help me, of course, even if I would let them. Lose two turns. With my library books and my groceries, going slowly, I had to walk down the sidewalk past the general store and into Stella\u2019s. I stopped in the doorway of the grocery, feeling around inside myself for some thought to make me safe. Behind me the little stirrings and coughings began. They were getting ready to talk again, and across the width of the store the Elberts were probably rolling their eyes at each other in relief. I froze my face hard. Today I was going to think about taking our lunch out into the garden, and while I kept my eyes open just enough to see where I was walking\u2014our mother\u2019s brown shoes going up and down\u2014in my mind I was setting the table with a green cloth and bringing out yellow dishes and strawberries in a white bowl. Yellow dishes, I thought, feeling the eyes of the men looking at me as I went by, and Uncle Julian shall have a nice soft egg with toast broken into it, and I will remember to ask Constance to put a shawl across his shoulders because it is still very early spring. Without looking I could see the grinning and the gesturing; I wished they were all dead and I was walking on their bodies. They rarely spoke directly to me, but only to each other. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the Blackwood girls,\u201d I heard one of them say in a high mocking voice, \u201cone of the Blackwood girls from Blackwood Farm.\u201d \u201cToo bad about the Blackwoods,\u201d someone else said, just loud enough, \u201ctoo bad about those poor girls.\u201d \u201cNice farm out there,\u201d they said, \u201cnice land to farm. Man could get rich, farming the Blackwood land. If he had a million years and three heads, and didn\u2019t care what grew, a man could get rich. Keep their land pretty well locked up, the Blackwoods do.\u201d \u201cMan could get rich.\u201d \u201cToo bad about the Blackwood girls.\u201d \u201cNever can tell what\u2019ll grow on Blackwood land.\u201d I am walking on their bodies, I thought, we are having lunch in the garden and Uncle Julian is wearing his shawl. I always held my groceries carefully along here, because one terrible morning I had dropped the shopping bag and the eggs broke and the milk spilled and I gathered up what I could while they shouted, telling myself that whatever I did I would not run away, shovelling cans and boxes andspilled sugar wildly back into the shopping bag, telling myself not to run away. In front of Stella\u2019s there was a crack in the sidewalk that looked like a finger pointing; the crack had always been there. Other landmarks, like the handprint Johnny Harris made in the concrete foundation of the town hall and the Mueller boy\u2019s initials on the library porch, had been put in in times that I remembered; I was in the third grade at the school when the town hall was built. But the crack in the sidewalk in front of Stella\u2019s had always been there, just as Stella\u2019s had always been there. I remember roller-skating across the crack, and being careful not to step on it or it would break our mother\u2019s back, and riding a bicycle past here with my hair flying behind; the villagers had not openly disliked us then although our father said they were trash. Our mother told me once that the crack was here when she was a girl in the Rochester house, so it must have been here when she married our father and went to live on Blackwood Farm, and I suppose the crack was there, like a finger pointing, from the time when the village was first put together out of old grey wood and the ugly people with their evil faces were brought from some impossible place and set down in the houses to live. Stella bought the coffee urn and put in the marble counter with the insurance money when her husband died, but otherwise there had been no change in Stella\u2019s since I could remember; Constance and I had come in here to spend pennies after school and every afternoon we picked up the newspaper to take home for our father to read in the evening; we no longer bought newspapers, but Stella still sold them, along with magazines and penny candy and grey postcards of the town hall. \u201cGood morning, Mary Katherine,\u201d Stella said when I sat down at the counter and put my groceries on the floor; I sometimes thought when I wished all the village people dead that I might spare Stella because she was the closest to kind that any of them could be, and the only one who managed to keep hold of any color at all. She was round and pink and when she put on a bright print dress it stayed looking bright for a little while before it merged into the dirty grey of the rest. \u201cHow are you today?\u201d she asked. \u201cVery well, thank you.\u201d \u201cAnd Constance Blackwood, is she well?\u201d \u201cVery well, thank you.\u201d \u201cAnd how is he ?\u201d\u201cAs well as can be expected. Black coffee, please.\u201d I really preferred sugar and cream in my coffee, because it is such bitter stuff, but since I only came here out of pride I needed to accept only the barest minimum for token. If anyone came into Stella\u2019s while I was there I got up and left quietly, but some days I had bad luck. This morning she had only set my coffee down on the counter when there was a shadow against the doorway, and Stella looked up, and said, \u201cGood morning, Jim.\u201d She went down to the other end of the counter and waited, expecting him to sit down there so I could leave without being noticed, but it was Jim Donell and I knew at once that today I had bad luck. Some of the people in the village had real faces that I knew and could hate individually; Jim Donell and his wife were among these, because they were deliberate instead of just hating dully and from habit like the others. Most people would have stayed down at the end of the counter where Stella waited, but Jim Donell came right to the end where I was sitting and took the stool next to me, as close to me as he could come because, I knew, he wanted this morning to be bad luck for me. \u201cThey tell me,\u201d he said, swinging to sit sideways on his stool and look at me directly, \u201cthey tell me you\u2019re moving away.\u201d I wished he would not sit so close to me; Stella came toward us on the inside of the counter and I wished she would ask him to move so I could get up and leave without having to struggle around him. \u201cThey tell me you\u2019re moving away,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, because he was waiting. \u201cFunny,\u201d he said, looking from me to Stella and then back. \u201cI could have swore someone told me you\u2019d be going soon.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cCoffee, Jim?\u201d Stella asked. \u201cWho do you think would of started a story like that, Stella? Who do you think would want to tell me they\u2019re moving away when they\u2019re not doing any such thing?\u201d Stella shook her head at him, but she was trying not to smile. I saw that my hands were tearing at the paper napkin in my lap, ripping off a little corner, and I forced my hands to be still and made a rule for myself: Whenever I saw a tiny scrap of paper I was to remember to be kinder to Uncle Julian. \u201cCan\u2019t ever tell how gossip gets around,\u201d Jim Donell said. Perhaps someday soon Jim Donell would die; perhaps there was already a rot growing inside him that was going to kill him. \u201cDid you ever hear anything like the gossip in this town?\u201d he asked Stella.\u201cLeave her alone, Jim,\u201d Stella said. Uncle Julian was an old man and he was dying, dying regrettably, more surely than Jim Donell and Stella and anyone else. The poor old Uncle Julian was dying and I made a firm rule to be kinder to him. We would have a picnic lunch on the lawn. Constance would bring his shawl and put it over his shoulders, and I would lie on the grass. \u201cI\u2019m not bothering anybody, Stell. Am I bothering anybody? I\u2019m just asking Miss Mary Katherine Blackwood here how it happens everyone in town is saying she and her big sister are going to be leaving us soon. Moving away. Going somewheres else to live.\u201d He stirred his coffee; from the corner of my eye I could see the spoon going around and around and around, and I wanted to laugh. There was something so simple and silly about the spoon going around while Jim Donell talked; I wondered if he would stop talking if I reached out and took hold of the spoon. Very likely he would, I told myself wisely, very likely he would throw the coffee in my face. \u201cGoing somewheres else,\u201d he said sadly. \u201cCut it out,\u201d Stella said. I would listen more carefully when Uncle Julian told his story. I was already bringing peanut brittle; that was good. \u201cHere I was all upset,\u201d Jim Donell said, \u201cthinking the town would be losing one of its fine old families. That would be really too bad.\u201d He swung the other way around on the stool because someone else was coming through the doorway; I was looking at my hands in my lap and of course would not turn around to see who was coming, but then Jim Donell said \u201cJoe,\u201d and I knew it was Dunham, the carpenter; \u201cJoe, you ever hear anything like this? Here all over town they\u2019re saying that the Blackwoods are moving away, and now Miss Mary Katherine Blackwood sits right here and speaks up and tells me they\u2019re not.\u201d There was a little silence. I knew that Dunham was scowling, looking at Jim Donell and at Stella and at me, thinking over what he had heard, sorting out the words and deciding what each one meant. \u201cThat so?\u201d he said at last. \u201cListen, you two,\u201d Stella said, but Jim Donell went right on, talking with his back to me, and his legs stretched out so I could not get past him and outside. \u201cI was saying to people only this morning it\u2019s too bad when the old families go. Although you could rightly say a good number of the Blackwoods are gone already.\u201d He laughed, and slapped the counter with his hand. \u201cGone already,\u201d he said again. The spoon in his cup was still, but he was talking on. \u201cA village loses a lot of stylewhen the fine old people go. Anyone would think,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cthat they wasn\u2019t wanted.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Dunham said, and he laughed. \u201cThe way they live up in their fine old private estate, with their fences and their private path and their stylish way of living.\u201d He always went on until he was tired. When Jim Donell thought of something to say he said it as often and in as many ways as possible, perhaps because he had very few ideas and had to wring each one dry. Besides, each time he repeated himself he thought it was funnier; I knew he might go on like this until he was really sure that no one was listening any more, and I made a rule for myself: Never think anything more than once, and I put my hands quietly in my lap. I am living on the moon, I told myself, I have a little house all by myself on the moon. \u201cWell,\u201d Jim Donell said; he smelled, too. \u201cI can always tell people I used to know the Blackwoods. They never did anything to me that I can remember, always perfectly polite to me. Not,\u201d he said, and laughed, \u201cthat I ever got invited to take my dinner with them, nothing like that.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s enough right there,\u201d Stella said, and her voice was sharp. \u201cYou go pick on someone else, Jim Donell.\u201d \u201cWas I picking on anyone? You think I wanted to be asked to dinner? You think I\u2019m crazy? \u201d \u201cMe,\u201d Dunham said, \u201cI can always tell people I fixed their broken step once and never got paid for it.\u201d That was true. Constance had sent me out to tell him that we wouldn\u2019t pay carpenter\u2019s prices for a raw board nailed crookedly across the step when what he was supposed to do was build it trim and new. When I went out and told him we wouldn\u2019t pay he grinned at me and spat, and picked up his hammer and pried the board loose and threw it on the ground. \u201cDo it yourself,\u201d he said to me, and got into his truck and drove away. \u201cNever did get paid for it,\u201d he said now. \u201cThat must of been an oversight, Joe. You just go right up and speak to Miss Constance Blackwood and she\u2019ll see you get what\u2019s coming to you. Just if you get invited to dinner, Joe, you just be sure and say no thank you to Miss Blackwood.\u201d Dunham laughed. \u201cNot me,\u201d he said. \u201cI fixed their step for them and never did get paid for it.\u201d \u201cFunny,\u201d Jim Donell said, \u201cthem getting the house fixed up and all, and planning to move away all the time.\u201d \u201cMary Katherine,\u201d Stella said, coming down inside the counter to where I was sitting, \u201cyou go along home. Just get up off that stool andgo along home. There won\u2019t be any peace around here until you go.\u201d \u201cNow, that\u2019s the truth,\u201d Jim Donell said. Stella looked at him, and he moved his legs and let me pass. \u201cYou just say the word, Miss Mary Katherine, and we\u2019ll all come out and help you pack. Just you say the word, Merricat.\u201d \u201cAnd you can tell your sister from me\u2014\u201d Dunham started to say, but I hurried, and by the time I got outside all I could hear was the laughter, the two of them and Stella. I liked my house on the moon, and I put a fireplace in it and a garden outside (what would flourish, growing on the moon? I must ask Constance) and I was going to have lunch outside in my garden on the moon. Things on the moon were very bright, and odd colors; my little house would be blue. I watched my small brown feet go in and out, and let the shopping bag swing a little by my side; I had been to Stella\u2019s and now I needed only to pass the town hall, which would be empty except for the people who made out dog licenses and the people who counted traffic fines from the drivers who followed the highway into the village and on through, and the people who sent out notices about water and sewage and garbage and forbade other people to burn leaves or to fish; these would all be buried somewhere deep inside the town hall, working busily together; I had nothing to fear from them unless I fished out of season. I thought of catching scarlet fish in the rivers on the moon and saw that the Harris boys were in their front yard, clamoring and quarrelling with half a dozen other boys. I had not been able to see them until I came past the corner by the town hall, and I could still have turned back and gone the other way, up the main highway to the creek, and then across the creek and home along the other half of the path to our house, but it was late, and I had the groceries, and the creek was nasty to wade in our mother\u2019s brown shoes, and I thought, I am living on the moon, and I walked quickly. They saw me at once, and I thought of them rotting away and curling in pain and crying out loud; I wanted them doubled up and crying on the ground in front of me. \u201cMerricat,\u201d they called, \u201cMerricat, Merricat,\u201d and moved all together to stand in a line by the fence. I wondered if their parents taught them, Jim Donell and Dunham and dirty Harris leading regular drills of their children, teaching them with loving care, making sure they pitched their voices right; how else could so many children learn so thoroughly?Merricat, said Connie, would you like a cup of tea? Oh no, said Merricat, you\u2019ll poison me. Merricat, said Connie, would you like to go to sleep? Down in the boneyard ten feet deep! I was pretending that I did not speak their language; on the moon we spoke a soft, liquid tongue, and sang in the starlight, looking down on the dead dried world; I was almost halfway past the fence. \u201cMerricat, Merricat!\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s old Connie\u2014home cooking dinner?\u201d \u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201d It was strange to be inside myself, walking steadily and rigidly past the fence, putting my feet down strongly but without haste that they might have noticed, to be inside and know that they were looking at me; I was hiding very far inside but I could hear them and see them still from one corner of my eye. I wished they were all lying there dead on the ground. \u201cDown in the boneyard ten feet deep.\u201d \u201cMerricat!\u201d Once when I was going past, the Harris boys\u2019 mother came out onto the porch, perhaps to see what they were all yelling so about. She stood there for a minute watching and listening and I stopped and looked at her, looking into her flat dull eyes and knowing I must not speak to her and knowing I would. \u201cCan\u2019t you make them stop?\u201d I asked her that day, wondering if there was anything in this woman I could speak to, if she had ever run joyfully over grass, or had watched flowers, or known delight or love. \u201cCan\u2019t you make them stop?\u201d \u201cKids,\u201d she said, not changing her voice or her look or her air of dull enjoyment, \u201cdon\u2019t call the lady names.\u201d \u201cYes, ma,\u201d one of the boys said soberly. \u201cDon\u2019t go near no fence. Don\u2019t call no lady names.\u201d And I walked on, while they shrieked and shouted and the woman stood on the porch and laughed. Merricat, said Connie, would you like a cup of tea? Oh, no, said Merricat, you\u2019ll poison me. Their tongues will burn, I thought, as though they had eaten fire. Their throats will burn when the words come out, and in their bellies they will feel a torment hotter than a thousand fires.\u201cGoodbye, Merricat,\u201d they called as I went by the end of the fence, \u201cdon\u2019t hurry back.\u201d \u201cGoodbye, Merricat, give our love to Connie.\u201d \u201cGoodbye, Merricat,\u201d but I was at the black rock and there was the gate to our path.2 I had to put down the shopping bag to open the lock on the gate; it was a simple padlock and any child could have broken it, but on the gate was a sign saying PRIVATE NO TRESPASSING and no one could go past that. Our father had put up the signs and the gates and the locks when he closed off the path; before, everyone used the path as a short- cut from the village to the highway four-corners where the bus stopped; it saved them perhaps a quarter of a mile to use our path and walk past our front door. Our mother disliked the sight of anyone who wanted to walking past our front door, and when our father brought her to live in the Blackwood house, one of the first things he had to do was close off the path and fence in the entire Blackwood property, from the highway to the creek. There was another gate at the other end of the path, although I rarely went that way, and that gate too had a padlock and a sign saying PRIVATE NO TRESPASSING. \u201cThe highway\u2019s built for common people,\u201d our mother said, \u201cand my front door is private.\u201d Anyone who came to see us, properly invited, came up the main drive which led straight from the gateposts on the highway up to our front door. When I was small I used to lie in my bedroom at the back of the house and imagine the driveway and the path as a crossroad meeting before our front door, and up and down the driveway went the good people, the clean and rich ones dressed in satin and lace, who came rightfully to visit, and back and forth along the path, sneaking and weaving and sidestepping servilely, went the people from the village. They can\u2019t get in, I used to tell myself over and over, lying in my dark room with the trees patterned in shadow on the ceiling, they can\u2019t ever get in any more; the path is closed forever. Sometimes I stood inside the fence, hidden by the bushes, and watched people walking on the highway to get from the village to the four corners. As far as I knew, no one from the village had ever tried to use the path since our father locked the gates. When I had moved the shopping bag inside, I carefully locked the gate again, and tested the padlock to make sure it held. Once the padlock was securely fastened behind me I was safe. The path was dark, because once our father had given up any idea of putting his land to profitable use he had let the trees and bushes and small flowers grow as they chose, and except for one great meadow and the gardensour land was heavily wooded, and no one knew its secret ways but me. When I went along the path, going easily now because I was home, I knew each step and every turn. Constance could put names to all the growing things, but I was content to know them by their way and place of growing, and their unfailing offers of refuge. The only prints on the path were my own, going in and out to the village. Past the turn I might find a mark of Constance\u2019s foot, because she sometimes came that far to wait for me, but most of Constance\u2019s prints were in the garden and in the house. Today she had come to the end of the garden, and I saw her as soon as I came around the turn; she was standing with the house behind her, in the sunlight, and I ran to meet her. \u201cMerricat,\u201d she said, smiling at me, \u201clook how far I came today.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too far,\u201d I said. \u201cFirst thing I know you\u2019ll be following me into the village.\u201d \u201cI might, at that,\u201d she said. Even though I knew she was teasing me I was chilled, but I laughed. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like it much,\u201d I told her. \u201cHere, lazy, take some of these packages. Where\u2019s my cat?\u201d \u201cHe went off chasing butterflies because you were late. Did you remember eggs? I forgot to tell you.\u201d \u201cOf course. Let\u2019s have lunch on the lawn.\u201d When I was small I thought Constance was a fairy princess. I used to try to draw her picture, with long golden hair and eyes as blue as the crayon could make them, and a bright pink spot on either cheek; the pictures always surprised me, because she did look like that; even at the worst time she was pink and white and golden, and nothing had ever seemed to dim the brightness of her. She was the most precious person in my world, always. I followed her across the soft grass, past the flowers she tended, into our house, and Jonas, my cat, came out of the flowers and followed me. Constance waited inside the tall front door while I came up the steps behind her, and then I put my packages down on the table in the hall and locked the door. We would not use it again until afternoon, because almost all of our life was lived toward the back of the house, on the lawn and the garden where no one else ever came. We left the front of the house turned toward the highway and the village, and went our own ways behind its stern, unwelcoming face. Although we kept the house well, the rooms we used together were the back ones, the kitchen and the back bedrooms and the little warm room off the kitchen where Uncle Julian lived; outside was Constance\u2019s chestnuttree and the wide, lovely reach of lawn and Constance\u2019s flowers and then, beyond, the vegetable garden Constance tended and, past that, the trees which shaded the creek. When we sat on the back lawn no one could see us from anywhere. I remembered that I was to be kinder to Uncle Julian when I saw him sitting at his great old desk in the kitchen corner playing with his papers. \u201cWill you let Uncle Julian have peanut brittle?\u201d I asked Constance. \u201cAfter his lunch,\u201d Constance said. She took the groceries carefully from the bags; food of any kind was precious to Constance, and she always touched foodstuffs with quiet respect. I was not allowed to help; I was not allowed to prepare food, nor was I allowed to gather mushrooms, although I sometimes carried vegetables in from the garden, or apples from the old trees. \u201cWe\u2019ll have muffins,\u201d Constance said, almost singing because she was sorting and putting away the food. \u201cUncle Julian will have an egg, done soft and buttery, and a muffin and a little pudding.\u201d \u201cPap,\u201d said Uncle Julian. \u201cMerricat will have something lean and rich and salty.\u201d \u201cJonas will catch me a mouse,\u201d I said to my cat on my knee. \u201cI\u2019m always so happy when you come home from the village,\u201d Constance said; she stopped to look and smile at me. \u201cPartly because you bring home food, of course. But partly because I miss you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m always happy to get home from the village,\u201d I told her. \u201cWas it very bad?\u201d She touched my cheek quickly with one finger. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know about it.\u201d \u201cSomeday I\u2019ll go.\u201d It was the second time she had spoken of going outside, and I was chilled. \u201cConstance,\u201d Uncle Julian said. He lifted a small scrap of paper from his desk and studied it, frowning. \u201cI do not seem to have any information on whether your father took his cigar in the garden as usual that morning.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure he did,\u201d Constance said. \u201cThat cat\u2019s been fishing in the creek,\u201d she told me. \u201cHe came in all mud.\u201d She folded the grocery bag and put it with the others in the drawer, and set the library books on the shelf where they were going to stay forever. Jonas and I were expected to stay in our corner, out of the way, while Constance worked in the kitchen, and it was a joy to watch her, moving beautifully in the sunlight, touching foods so softly. \u201cIt\u2019s Helen Clarke\u2019s day,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you frightened?\u201dShe turned to smile at me. \u201cNot a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m getting better all the time, I think. And today I\u2019m going to make little rum cakes.\u201d \u201cAnd Helen Clarke will scream and gobble them.\u201d Even now, Constance and I still saw some small society, visiting acquaintances who drove up the driveway to call. Helen Clarke took her tea with us on Fridays, and Mrs. Shepherd or Mrs. Rice or old Mrs. Crowley stopped by occasionally on a Sunday after church to tell us we would have enjoyed the sermon. They came dutifully, although we never returned their calls, and stayed a proper few minutes and sometimes brought flowers from their gardens, or books, or a song that Constance might care to try over on her harp; they spoke politely and with little runs of laughter, and never failed to invite us to their houses although they knew we would never come. They were civil to Uncle Julian, and patient with his talk, they offered to take us for drives in their cars, they referred to themselves as our friends. Constance and I always spoke well of them to each other, because they believed that their visits brought us pleasure. They never walked on the path. If Constance offered them a cutting from a rosebush, or invited them to see a happy new arrangement of colors, they went into the garden, but they never offered to step beyond their defined areas; they walked along the garden and got into their cars by the front door and drove away down the driveway and out through the big gates. Several times Mr. and Mrs. Carrington had come to see how we were getting along, because Mr. Carrington had been a very good friend of our father\u2019s. They never came inside or took any refreshment, but they drove to the front steps and sat in their car and talked for a few minutes. \u201cHow are you getting along?\u201d they always asked, looking from Constance to me and back; \u201chow are you managing all by yourselves? Is there anything you need, anything we can do? How are you getting along?\u201d Constance always invited them in, because we had been brought up to believe that it was discourteous to keep guests talking outside, but the Carringtons never came into the house. \u201cI wonder,\u201d I said, thinking about them, \u201cwhether the Carringtons would bring me a horse if I asked them. I could ride it in the long meadow.\u201d Constance turned and looked at me for a minute, frowning a little. \u201cYou will not ask them,\u201d she said at last. \u201cWe do not ask from anyone. Remember that.\u201d \u201cI was teasing,\u201d I said, and she smiled again. \u201cI really only want a winged horse, anyway. We could fly you to the moon and back, my horse and I.\u201d\u201cI remember when you used to want a griffin,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, Miss Idleness, run out and set the table.\u201d \u201cThey quarrelled hatefully that last night,\u201d Uncle Julian said. \u201cI won\u2019t have it,\u2019 she said,",

      "chapter_text": "them and although I deserve to die\u2014we all do, do we not? \u2014I hardly think that my niece is the one to point it out.\u201d \u201cShe told the police that it was all her fault.\u201d \u201cNow there,\u201d Uncle Julian said, \u201cI think she made a mistake. It was certainly true that she thought at first that her cooking had caused all this, but in taking full blame I think that she was over-eager. I would have advised her against any such attitude had I been consulted; it smacks of self-pity.\u201d\u201cBut the great, the unanswered question, is why ? Why did she do it? I mean, unless we agree that Constance was a homicidal maniac\u2014\u201d \u201cYou have met her, madam.\u201d \u201cI have what? Oh, my goodness yes. I completely forgot. I cannot seem to remember that that pretty young girl is actually\u2014well. Your mass murderer must have a reason, Mr. Blackwood, even if it is only some perverted, twisted\u2014oh, dear. She is such a charming girl, your niece; I cannot remember when I have taken to anyone as I have to her. But if she is a homicidal maniac\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d Helen Clarke stood up and slammed her pocketbook emphatically under her arm. \u201cLucille,\u201d she said, \u201cI am leaving. We have overstayed all limits of decency; it\u2019s after five o\u2019clock.\u201d Mrs. Wright scurried out of the dining room, distraught. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were chatting and I lost track of time. Oh, dear.\u201d She ran to her chair to gather up her pocketbook. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even touched your tea,\u201d I said, wanting to see her blush. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said; she looked down at her teacup and blushed. \u201cIt was delicious.\u201d Uncle Julian stopped his wheel chair in the center of the room and folded his hands happily before him. He looked at Constance and then raised his eyes to gaze on a corner of the ceiling, sober and demure. \u201cJulian, goodbye,\u201d Helen Clarke said shortly. \u201cConstance, I\u2019m sorry we stayed so long; it was inexcusable. Lucille?\u201d Mrs. Wright looked like a child who knows it is going to be punished, but she had not forgotten her manners. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said to Constance, putting her hand out and then taking it back again quickly. \u201cI had a very nice time. Goodbye,\u201d she said to Uncle Julian. They went into the hall and I followed, to lock the door after they had gone. Helen Clarke started the car before poor Mrs. Wright had quite finished getting herself inside, and the last I heard of Mrs. Wright was a little shriek as the car started down the driveway. I was laughing when I came back into the drawing room, and I went over and kissed Constance. \u201cA very nice tea party,\u201d I said. \u201cThat impossible woman.\u201d Constance put her head back against the couch and laughed. \u201cIll bred, pretentious, stupid. Why she keeps coming I\u2019ll never know.\u201d \u201cShe wants to reform you.\u201d I took up Mrs. Wright\u2019s teacup and her rum cake and brought them over to the tea tray. \u201cPoor little Mrs. Wright,\u201d I said.\u201cYou were teasing her, Merricat.\u201d \u201cA little bit, maybe. I can\u2019t help it when people are frightened; I always want to frighten them more.\u201d \u201cConstance?\u201d Uncle Julian turned his wheel chair to face her. \u201cHow was I?\u201d \u201cSuperb, Uncle Julian.\u201d Constance stood up and went over to him and touched his old head lightly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need your notes at all.\u201d \u201cIt really happened?\u201d he asked her. \u201cIt certainly did. I\u2019ll take you in to your room and you can look at your newspaper clippings.\u201d \u201cI think not right now. It has been a superlative afternoon, but I think I am a little tired. I will rest till dinner.\u201d Constance pushed the wheel chair down the hall and I followed with the tea tray. I was allowed to carry dirty dishes but not to wash them, so I set the tray on the kitchen table and watched while Constance stacked the dishes by the sink to wash later, swept up the broken milk pitcher on the floor, and took out the potatoes to start for dinner. Finally I had to ask her; the thought had been chilling me all afternoon. \u201cAre you going to do what she said?\u201d I asked her. \u201cWhat Helen Clarke said?\u201d She did not pretend not to understand. She stood there looking down at her hands working, and smiled a little. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.3 A change was coming, and nobody knew it but me. Constance suspected, perhaps; I noticed that she stood occasionally in her garden and looked not down at the plants she was tending, and not back at our house, but outward, toward the trees which hid the fence, and sometimes she looked long and curiously down the length of the driveway, as though wondering how it would feel to walk along it to the gates. I watched her. On Saturday morning, after Helen Clarke had come to tea, Constance looked at the driveway three times. Uncle Julian was not well on Saturday morning, after tiring himself at tea, and stayed in his bed in his warm room next to the kitchen, looking out of the window beside his pillow, calling now and then to make Constance notice him. Even Jonas was fretful\u2014he was running up a storm, our mother used to say\u2014and could not sleep quietly; all during those days when the change was coming Jonas stayed restless. From a deep sleep he would start suddenly, lifting his head as though listening, and then, on his feet and moving in one quick ripple, he ran up the stairs and across the beds and around through the doors in and out and then down the stairs and across the hall and over the chair in the dining room and around the table and through the kitchen and out into the garden where he would slow, sauntering, and then pause to lick a paw and flick an ear and take a look at the day. At night we could hear him running, feel him cross our feet as we lay in bed, running up a storm. All the omens spoke of change. I woke up on Saturday morning and thought I heard them calling me; they want me to get up, I thought before I came fully awake and remembered that they were dead; Constance never called me to wake up. When I dressed and came downstairs that morning she was waiting to make my breakfast, and I told her, \u201cI thought I heard them calling me this morning.\u201d \u201cHurry with your breakfast,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s another lovely day.\u201d After breakfast on the good mornings when I did not have to go into the village I had my work to do. Always on Wednesday mornings I went around the fence. It was necessary for me to check constantly to be sure that the wires were not broken and the gates were securely locked. I could make the repairs myself, winding the wire back together where it had torn, tightening loose strands, and it was a pleasure to know, every Wednesday morning, that we were safe for another week.On Sunday mornings I examined my safeguards, the box of silver dollars I had buried by the creek, and the doll buried in the long field, and the book nailed to the tree in the pine woods; so long as they were where I had put them nothing could get in to harm us. I had always buried things, even when I was small; I remember that once I quartered the long field and buried something in each quarter to make the grass grow higher as I grew taller, so I would always be able to hide there. I once buried six blue marbles in the creek bed to make the river beyond run dry. \u201cHere is treasure for you to bury,\u201d Constance used to say to me when I was small, giving me a penny, or a bright ribbon; I had buried all my baby teeth as they came out one by one and perhaps someday they would grow as dragons. All our land was enriched with my treasures buried in it, thickly inhabited just below the surface with my marbles and my teeth and my colored stones, all perhaps turned to jewels by now, held together under the ground in a powerful taut web which never loosened, but held fast to guard us. On Tuesdays and Fridays I went into the village, and on Thursday, which was my most powerful day, I went into the big attic and dressed in their clothes. Mondays we neatened the house, Constance and I, going into every room with mops and dustcloths, carefully setting the little things back after we had dusted, never altering the perfect line of our mother\u2019s tortoise-shell comb. Every spring we washed and polished the house for another year, but on Mondays we neatened; very little dust fell in their rooms, but even that little could not be permitted to stay. Sometimes Constance tried to neaten Uncle Julian\u2019s room, but Uncle Julian disliked being disturbed and kept his things in their own places, and Constance had to be content with washing his medicine glasses and changing his bed. I was not allowed in Uncle Julian\u2019s room. On Saturday mornings I helped Constance. I was not allowed to handle knives, but when she worked in the garden I cared for her tools, keeping them bright and clean, and I carried great baskets of flowers, sometimes, or vegetables which Constance picked to make into food. The entire cellar of our house was filled with food. All the Blackwood women had made food and had taken pride in adding to the great supply of food in our cellar. There were jars of jam made by great- grandmothers, with labels in thin pale writing, almost unreadable by now, and pickles made by great-aunts and vegetables put up by our grandmother, and even our mother had left behind her six jars of apple jelly. Constance had worked all her life at adding to the food in thecellar, and her rows and rows of jars were easily the handsomest, and shone among the others. \u201cYou bury food the way I bury treasure,\u201d I told her sometimes, and she answered me once: \u201cThe food comes from the ground and can\u2019t be permitted to stay there and rot; some thing has to be done with it.\u201d All the Blackwood women had taken the food that came from the ground and preserved it, and the deeply colored rows of jellies and pickles and bottled vegetables and fruit, maroon and amber and dark rich green, stood side by side in our cellar and would stand there forever, a poem by the Blackwood women. Each year Constance and Uncle Julian and I had jam or preserve or pickle that Constance had made, but we never touched what belonged to the others; Constance said it would kill us if we ate it. This Saturday morning I had apricot jam on my toast, and I thought of Constance making it and putting it away carefully for me to eat on some bright morning, never dreaming that a change would be coming before the jar was finished. \u201cLazy Merricat,\u201d Constance said to me, \u201cstop dreaming over your toast; I want you in the garden on this lovely day.\u201d She was arranging Uncle Julian\u2019s tray, putting his hot milk into a jug painted with yellow daisies, and trimming his toast so it would be tiny and hot and square; if anything looked large, or difficult to eat, Uncle Julian would leave it on the plate. Constance always took Uncle Julian\u2019s tray in to him in the morning because he slept painfully and sometimes lay awake in the darkness waiting for the first light and the comfort of Constance with his tray. Some nights, when his heart hurt him badly, he might take one more pill than usual, and then lie all morning drowsy and dull, unwilling to sip from his hot milk, but wanting to know that Constance was busy in the kitchen next door to his bedroom, or in the garden where he could see her from his pillow. On his very good mornings she brought him into the kitchen for his breakfast, and he would sit at his old desk in the corner, spilling crumbs among his notes, studying his papers while he ate. \u201cIf I am spared,\u201d he always said to Constance, \u201cI will write the book myself. If not, see that my notes are entrusted to some worthy cynic who will not be too concerned with the truth.\u201d I wanted to be kinder to Uncle Julian, so this morning I hoped he would enjoy his breakfast and later come out into the garden in his wheel chair and sit in the sun. \u201cMaybe there will be a tulip open today,\u201d I said, looking out through the open kitchen door into the bright sunlight.\u201cNot until tomorrow, I think,\u201d said Constance, who always knew. \u201cWear your boots if you wander today; it will still be quite wet in the woods.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a change coming,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s spring, silly,\u201d she said, and took up Uncle Julian\u2019s tray. \u201cDon\u2019t run off while I\u2019m gone; there\u2019s work to be done.\u201d She opened Uncle Julian\u2019s door and I heard her say good morning to him. When he said good morning back his voice was old and I knew that he was not well. Constance would have to stay near him all day. \u201cIs your father home yet, child?\u201d he asked her. \u201cNo, not today,\u201d Constance said. \u201cLet me get your other pillow. It\u2019s a lovely day.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a busy man,\u201d Uncle Julian said. \u201cBring me a pencil, my dear; I want to make a note of that. He\u2019s a very busy man.\u201d \u201cTake some hot milk; it will make you warm.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not Dorothy. You\u2019re my niece Constance.\u201d \u201cDrink.\u201d \u201cGood morning, Constance.\u201d \u201cGood morning, Uncle Julian.\u201d I decided that I would choose three powerful words, words of strong protection, and so long as these great words were never spoken aloud no change would come. I wrote the first word\u2014 melody \u2014in the apricot jam on my toast with the handle of a spoon and then put the toast in my mouth and ate it very quickly. I was one-third safe. Constance came out of Uncle Julian\u2019s room carrying the tray. \u201cHe\u2019s not well this morning,\u201d she said. \u201cHe left most of his breakfast and he\u2019s very tired.\u201d \u201cIf I had a winged horse I could fly him to the moon; he would be more comfortable there.\u201d \u201cLater I\u2019ll take him out into the sunshine, and perhaps make him a little eggnog.\u201d \u201cEverything\u2019s safe on the moon.\u201d She looked at me distantly. \u201cDandelion greens,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd radishes. I thought of working in the vegetable garden this morning, but I don\u2019t want to leave Uncle Julian. I hope that the carrots . . .\u201d She tapped her fingers on the table, thinking. \u201cRhubarb,\u201d she said. I carried my breakfast dishes over to the sink and set them down; I was deciding on my second magic word, which I thought might very well be Gloucester. It was strong, and I thought it would do, although Uncle Julian might take it into his head to say almost anything and noword was truly safe when Uncle Julian was talking. \u201cWhy not make a pie for Uncle Julian?\u201d Constance smiled. \u201cYou mean, why not make a pie for Merricat? Shall I make a rhubarb pie?\u201d \u201cJonas and I dislike rhubarb.\u201d \u201cBut it has the prettiest colors of all; nothing is so pretty on the shelves as rhubarb jam.\u201d \u201cMake it for the shelves, then. Make me a dandelion pie.\u201d \u201cSilly Merricat,\u201d Constance said. She was wearing her blue dress, the sunlight was patterned on the kitchen floor, and color was beginning to show in the garden outside. Jonas sat on the step, washing, and Constance began to sing as she turned to wash the dishes. I was two- thirds safe, with only one magic word to find. Later Uncle Julian still slept and Constance thought to take five minutes and run down to the vegetable garden to gather what she could; I sat at the kitchen table listening for Uncle Julian so I could call Constance if he awakened, but when she came back he was still quiet. I ate tiny sweet raw carrots while Constance washed the vegetables and put them away. \u201cWe will have a spring salad,\u201d she said. \u201cWe eat the year away. We eat the spring and the summer and the fall. We wait for something to grow and then we eat it.\u201d \u201cSilly Merricat,\u201d Constance said. At twenty minutes after eleven by the kitchen clock she took off her apron, glanced in at Uncle Julian, and went, as she always did, upstairs to her room to wait until I called her. I went to the front door and unlocked it and opened it just as the doctor\u2019s car turned into the drive. He was in a hurry, always, and he stopped his car quickly and ran up the steps; \u201cGood morning, Miss Blackwood,\u201d he said, going past me and down the hall, and by the time he had reached the kitchen he had his coat off and was ready to put it over the back of one of the kitchen chairs. He went directly to Uncle Julian\u2019s room without a glance at me or at the kitchen, and then when he opened Uncle Julian\u2019s door he was suddenly still, and gentle. \u201cGood morning, Mr. Blackwood,\u201d he said, his voice easy, \u201chow are things today?\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s the old fool?\u201d Uncle Julian said, as he always did. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Jack Mason come?\u201d Dr. Mason was the one Constance called the night they all died. \u201cDr. Mason couldn\u2019t make it today,\u201d the doctor said, as he always did. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Levy. I\u2019ve come to see you instead.\u201d \u201cRather have Jack Mason.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do the best I can.\u201d \u201cAlways said I\u2019d outlive the old fool.\u201d Uncle Julian laughed thinly. \u201cWhy are you pretending with me? Jack Mason died three years ago.\u201d \u201cMr. Blackwood,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cit is a pleasure to have you as a patient.\u201d He closed the door very quietly. I thought of using digitalis as my third magic word, but it was too easy for someone to say, and at last I decided on Pegasus. I took a glass from the cabinet, and said the word very distinctly into the glass, then filled it with water and drank. Uncle Julian\u2019s door opened, and the doctor stood in the doorway for a minute. \u201cRemember, now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll see you next Saturday.\u201d \u201cQuack,\u201d Uncle Julian said. The doctor turned, smiling, and then the smile disappeared and he began to hurry again. He took up his coat and went off down the hall. I followed him and by the time I came to the front door he was already going down the steps. \u201cGoodbye, Miss Blackwood,\u201d he said, not looking around, and got into his car and started at once, going faster and faster until he reached the gates and turned onto the highway. I locked the front door and went to the foot of the stairs. \u201cConstance?\u201d I called. \u201cComing,\u201d she said from upstairs. \u201cComing, Merricat.\u201d Uncle Julian was better later in the day, and sat out in the warm afternoon sun, hands folded in his lap, half-dreaming. I lay near him on the marble bench our mother had liked to sit on, and Constance knelt in the dirt, both hands buried as though she were growing, kneading the dirt and turning it, touching the plants on their roots. \u201cIt was a fine morning,\u201d Uncle Julian said, his voice going on and on, \u201ca fine bright morning, and none of them knew it was their last. She was downstairs first, my niece Constance. I woke up and heard her moving in the kitchen\u2014I slept upstairs then, I could still go upstairs, and I slept with my wife in our room\u2014and I thought, this is a fine morning, never dreaming then that it was their last. Then I heard my nephew\u2014no, it was my brother; my brother came downstairs first after Constance. I heard him whistling. Constance?\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d \u201cWhat was the tune my brother used to whistle, and always off-key?\u201d Constance thought, her hands in the ground, and hummed softly, and I shivered. \u201cOf course. I never had a head for music; I could remember what people looked like and what they said and what they did but I could never remember what they sang. It was my brother who camedownstairs after Constance, never caring of course if he woke people with his noise and his whistling, never thinking that perhaps I might still be asleep, although as it happened I was already awake.\u201d Uncle Julian sighed, and lifted his head to look curiously, once, around the garden. \u201cHe never knew it was his last morning on earth. He might have been quieter, I think, if he did know. I heard him in the kitchen with Constance and I said to my wife\u2014she was awake, too; his noise had awakened her\u2014I said to my wife, you had better get dressed; we live here with my brother and his wife, after all, and we must remember to show them that we are friendly and eager to help out wherever we can; dress and go down to Constance in the kitchen. She did as she was told; our wives always did as they were told, although my sister-in-law lay in bed late that morning; perhaps she had a premonition and wanted to take her earthly rest while she could. I heard them all. I heard the boy go downstairs. I thought of dressing; Constance?\u201d \u201cYes, Uncle Julian?\u201d \u201cI could still dress myself in those days, you know, although that was the last day. I could still walk around by myself, and dress myself, and feed myself, and I had no pain. I slept well in those days as a strong man should. I was not young, but I was strong and I slept well and I could still dress myself.\u201d \u201cWould you like a rug over your knees?\u201d \u201cNo, my dear, I thank you. You have been a good niece to me, although there are some grounds for supposing you an undutiful daughter. My sister-in-law came downstairs before I did. We had pancakes for breakfast, tiny thin hot pancakes, and my brother had two fried eggs and my wife\u2014although I did not encourage her to eat heavily, since we were living with my brother\u2014took largely of sausage. Homemade sausage, made by Constance. Constance?\u201d \u201cYes, Uncle Julian?\u201d \u201cI think if I had known it was her last breakfast I would have permitted her more sausage. I am surprised, now I think of it, that no one suspected it was their last morning; they might not have grudged my wife more sausage then. My brother sometimes remarked upon what we ate, my wife and I; he was a just man, and never stinted his food, so long as we did not take too much. He watched my wife take sausage that morning, Constance. I saw him watching her. We took little enough from him, Constance. He had pancakes and fried eggs and sausage but I felt that he was going to speak to my wife; the boyate hugely. I am pleased that the breakfast was particularly good that day.\u201d \u201cI could make you sausage next week, Uncle Julian; I think homemade sausage would not disagree with you if you had very little.\u201d \u201cMy brother never grudged our food if we did not take too much. My wife helped to wash the dishes.\u201d \u201cI was very grateful to her.\u201d \u201cShe might have done more, I think now. She entertained my sister- in-law, and she saw to our clothes, and she helped with the dishes in the mornings, but I believe that my brother thought that she might have done more. He went off after breakfast to see a man on business.\u201d \u201cHe wanted an arbor built; it was his plan to start a grape arbor.\u201d \u201cI am sorry about that; we might now be eating jam from our own grapes. I was always better able to chat after he was gone; I recall that I entertained the ladies that morning, and we sat here in the garden. We talked about music; my wife was quite musical although she had never learned to play. My sister-in-law had a delicate touch; it was always said of her that she had a delicate touch, and she played in the evenings usually. Not that evening, of course. She was not able to play that evening. In the morning we thought she would play in the evening as usual. Do you recall that I was very entertaining in the garden that morning, Constance?\u201d \u201cI was weeding the vegetables,\u201d Constance said. \u201cI could hear you all laughing.\u201d \u201cI was quite entertaining; I am happy for that now.\u201d He was quiet for a minute, folding and refolding his hands. I wanted to be kinder to him, but I could not fold his hands for him, and there was nothing I could bring him, so I lay still and listened to him talk. Constance frowned, staring at a leaf, and the shadows moved softly across the lawn. \u201cThe boy was off somewhere,\u201d Uncle Julian said at last in his sad old voice. \u201cThe boy had gone off somewhere\u2014was he fishing, Constance?\u201d \u201cHe was climbing the chestnut tree.\u201d \u201cI remember. Of course. I remember all of it very clearly, my dear, and I have it all down in my notes. It was the last morning of all and I would not like to forget. He was climbing the chestnut tree, shouting down to us from very high in the tree, and dropping twigs until my sister-in-law spoke sharply to him. She disliked the twigs falling into her hair, and my wife disliked it too, although she would never have been the first to speak. I think my wife was civil to your mother,Constance. I would hate to think not; we lived in my brother\u2019s house and ate his food. I know my brother was home for lunch.\u201d \u201cWe had a rarebit,\u201d Constance said. \u201cI had been working with the vegetables all morning and I had to make something quickly for lunch.\u201d \u201cIt was a rarebit we had. I have often wondered why the arsenic was never put into the rarebit. It is an interesting point, and one I shall bring out forcefully in my book. Why was the arsenic not put into the rarebit? They would have lost some hours of life on that last day, but it would all have been over with that much sooner. Constance, if there is one dish you prepare which I strongly dislike, it is a rarebit. I have never cared for rarebit.\u201d \u201cI know, Uncle Julian. I never serve it to you.\u201d \u201cIt would have been most suitable for the arsenic. I had a salad instead, I recall. There was an apple pudding for dessert, left over from the night before.\u201d \u201cThe sun is going down.\u201d Constance rose and brushed the dirt from her hands. \u201cYou\u2019ll be chilly unless I take you indoors.\u201d \u201cIt would have been far more suitable in the rarebit, Constance. Odd that the point was never brought out at the time. Arsenic is tasteless, you know, although I swear a rarebit is not. Where am I going?\u201d \u201cYou are going indoors. You will rest in your room for an hour until your dinner, and after dinner I will play for you, if you like.\u201d \u201cI cannot afford the time, my dear. I have a thousand details to remember and note down, and not a minute to waste. I would hate to lose any small thing from their last day; my book must be complete. I think, on the whole, it was a pleasant day for all of them, and of course it is much better that they never supposed it was to be their last. I think I am chilly, Constance.\u201d \u201cYou will be tucked away in your room in a minute.\u201d I came slowly behind them, unwilling to leave the darkening garden; Jonas came after me, moving toward the light in the house. When Jonas and I came inside Constance was just closing the door to Uncle Julian\u2019s room, and she smiled at me. \u201cHe\u2019s practically asleep already,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWhen I\u2019m as old as Uncle Julian will you take care of me?\u201d I asked her. \u201cIf I\u2019m still around,\u201d she said, and I was chilled. I sat in my corner holding Jonas and watched her move quickly and silently around our bright kitchen. In a few minutes she would ask me to set the table forthe three of us in the dining room, and then after dinner it would be night and we would sit warmly together in the kitchen where we were guarded by the house and no one from outside could see so much as a light.4 On Sunday morning the change was one day nearer. I was resolute about not thinking my three magic words and would not let them into my mind, but the air of change was so strong that there was no avoiding it; change lay over the stairs and the kitchen and the garden like fog. I would not forget my magic words; they were MELODY GLOUCESTER PEGASUS, but I refused to let them into my mind. The weather was uneasy on Sunday morning and I thought that perhaps Jonas would succeed after all in running up a storm; the sun shone into the kitchen but there were clouds moving quickly across the sky and a sharp little breeze that came in and out of the kitchen while I had my breakfast. \u201cWear your boots if you wander today,\u201d Constance told me. \u201cI don\u2019t expect that Uncle Julian will sit outdoors today; it will be far too cool for him.\u201d \u201cPure spring weather,\u201d Constance said, and smiled out at her garden. \u201cI love you, Constance,\u201d I said. \u201cI love you too, silly Merricat.\u201d \u201cIs Uncle Julian better?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so. He had his tray while you were still asleep, and I thought he seemed very tired. He said he had an extra pill during the night. I think perhaps he is getting worse.\u201d \u201cAre you worried about him?\u201d \u201cYes. Very.\u201d \u201cWill he die?\u201d \u201cDo you know what he said to me this morning?\u201d Constance turned, leaning against the sink, and looked at me with sadness. \u201cHe thought I was Aunt Dorothy, and he held my hand and said, \u2018It\u2019s terrible to be old, and just lie here wondering when it will happen.\u2019 He almost frightened me.\u201d \u201cYou should have let me take him to the moon,\u201d I said. \u201cI gave him his hot milk and then he remembered who I was.\u201d I thought that Uncle Julian was probably really very happy, with both Constance and Aunt Dorothy to take care of him, and I told myself that long thin things would remind me to be kinder to Uncle Julian; this was to be a day of long thin things, since there had already been a hair in my toothbrush, and a fragment of a string was caught on the side of my chair and I could see a splinter broken off the back step.\u201cMake him a little pudding,\u201d I said. \u201cPerhaps I will.\u201d She took out the long thin slicing knife and set it on the sink. \u201cOr a cup of cocoa. And dumplings with his chicken tonight.\u201d \u201cDo you need me?\u201d \u201cNo, my Merricat. Run along, and wear your boots.\u201d The day outside was full of changing light, and Jonas danced in and out of shadows as he followed me. When I ran Jonas ran, and when I stopped and stood still he stopped and glanced at me and then went briskly off in another direction, as though we were not acquainted, and then he sat down and waited for me to run again. We were going to the long field which today looked like an ocean, although I had never seen an ocean; the grass was moving in the breeze and the cloud shadows passed back and forth and the trees in the distance moved. Jonas disappeared into the grass, which was tall enough for me to touch with my hands while I walked, and he made small crooked movements of his own; for a minute the grass would all bend together under the breeze and then there would be a hurrying pattern across it where Jonas was running. I started at one corner and walked diagonally across the long field toward the opposite corner, and in the middle I came directly to the rock covering the spot where the doll was buried; I could always find it although much of my buried treasure was forever lost. The rock was undisturbed and so the doll was safe. I am walking on buried treasure, I thought, with the grass brushing against my hands and nothing around me but the reach of the long field with the grass blowing and the pine woods at the end; behind me was the house, and far off to my left, hidden by trees and almost out of sight, was the wire fence our father had built to keep people out. When I left the long field I went between the four apple trees we called our orchard, and along the path toward the",

      "chapter_text": "standing open and I could see the movement of fire inside. Fire burns upward, I thought; it will burn their things in the attic. Charles had left the front door open too, and a line of smoke reached down the stairs and drifted outside. I did not see any need to move quickly or to run shrieking around the house because the fire did not seem to be hurrying itself. I wondered if I could go up the stairs and shut the door to our father\u2019s room and keep the fire inside, belonging entirely to Charles, but when I started up the stairs I saw a finger of flame reach out to touch the hall carpet and some heavy object fell crashing in our father\u2019s room. There would be nothing of Charles in there now; even his pipe must have been consumed. \u201cUncle Julian is gathering his papers,\u201d Constance said, coming into the hall to stand beside me. She had Uncle Julian\u2019s shawl over her arm. \u201cWe will have to go outside,\u201d I said. I knew that she was frightened, so I said, \u201cWe can stay on the porch, behind the vines, in the darkness.\u201d \u201cWe neatened it just the other day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has no right to burn.\u201d She began to shiver as though she were angry, and I took her by the hand and brought her through the open front door and just as we turned back for another look the lights came into the driveway with the disgusting noise of sirens and we were held in the doorway in the light. Constance put her face against me to hide, and then there was Jim Donell, the first one to leap from the fire engine and run up the steps. \u201cOut of the way,\u201d he said, and pushed past us and into our house. I took Constance along the porch to the corner where the vines grew thick, and she moved into the corner and pressed against the vines. I held her hand tight, and together we watched the great feet of the men stepping across our doorsill, dragging their hoses, bringing filth and confusion and danger into our house. More lights moved into the driveway and up to the steps, and the front of the house was white and pale and uncomfortable at being so clearly visible; it had never been lighted before. The noise was too much for me to hear all together, butsomewhere in the noise was Charles\u2019 voice, still going on and on. \u201cGet the safe in the study,\u201d he said a thousand times. Smoke squeezed out the front door, coming between the big men pushing in. \u201cConstance,\u201d I whispered, \u201cConstance, don\u2019t watch them.\u201d \u201cCan they see me?\u201d she whispered back. \u201cIs anyone looking?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re all watching the fire. Be very quiet.\u201d I looked carefully out between the vines. There was a long row of cars, and the village fire engine, all parked as close to the house as they could get, and everyone in the village was there, looking up and watching. I saw faces laughing, and faces that looked frightened, and then someone called out, very near to us, \u201cWhat about the women, and the old man? Anyone see them?\u201d \u201cThey had plenty of warning,\u201d Charles shouted from somewhere, \u201cthey\u2019re all right.\u201d Uncle Julian could manage his chair well enough to get out the back door, I thought, but it did not seem that the fire was going near the kitchen or Uncle Julian\u2019s room; I could see the hoses and hear the men shouting, and they were all on the stairs and in the front bedrooms upstairs. I could not get through the front door, and even if I could leave Constance there was no way to go around to the back door without going down the steps in the light with all of them watching. \u201cWas Uncle Julian frightened?\u201d I whispered to Constance. \u201cI think he was annoyed,\u201d she said. A few minutes later she said, \u201cIt will take a great deal of scrubbing to get that hall clean again,\u201d and sighed. I was pleased that she thought of the house and forgot the people outside. \u201cJonas?\u201d I said to her; \u201cwhere is he?\u201d I could see her smile a little in the darkness of the vines. \u201cHe was annoyed, too,\u201d she said. \u201cHe went out the back door when I took Uncle Julian in to get his papers.\u201d We were all right. Uncle Julian might very well forget that there was a fire at all if he became interested in his papers, and Jonas was almost certainly watching from the shadow of the trees. When they had finished putting out Charles\u2019 fire I would take Constance back inside and we could start to clean our house again. Constance was quieter, although more and more cars came down the driveway and the unending patter of feet went back and forth across our doorsill. Except for Jim Donell, who wore a hat proclaiming him \u201cChief,\u201d it was impossible to identify any one person, any more than it was possible to put a name to any of the faces out in front of our house, looking up andlaughing at the fire. I tried to think clearly. The house was burning; there was fire inside our house, but Jim Donell and the other, anonymous, men in hats and raincoats were curiously able to destroy the fire which was running through the bones of our house. It was Charles\u2019 fire. When I listened particularly for the fire I could hear it, a singing hot noise upstairs, but over and around it, smothering it, were the voices of the men inside and the voices of the people watching outside and the distant sound of cars on the driveway. Next to me Constance was standing quietly, sometimes looking at the men going into the house, but more often covering her eyes with her hands; she was excited, I thought, but not in any danger. Every now and then it was possible to hear one voice raised above the others; Jim Donell shouted some word of instruction, or someone in the crowd called out. \u201cWhy not let it burn?\u201d a woman\u2019s voice came loudly, laughing, and \u201cGet the safe out of the study downstairs\u201d; that was Charles, safely in the crowd out front. \u201cWhy not let it burn?\u201d the woman called insistently, and one of the dark men going in and out of our front door turned and waved and grinned. \u201cWe\u2019re the firemen,\u201d he called back, \u201cwe got to put it out.\u201d \u201cLet it burn,\u201d the woman called. Smoke was everywhere, thick and ugly. Sometimes when I looked out the faces of the people were clouded with smoke, and it came out the front door in frightening waves. Once there was a crash from inside the house and voices speaking quickly and urgently, and the faces outside turned up happily in the smoke, mouths open. \u201cGet the safe,\u201d Charles called out wildly, \u201ctwo or three of you men get the safe out of the study; the whole house is going.\u201d \u201cLet it burn,\u201d the woman called. I was hungry and I wanted my dinner, and I wondered how long they could make the fire last before they put it out and went away and Constance and I could go back inside. One or two of the village boys had edged onto the porch dangerously close to where we stood, but they only looked inside, not at the porch, and tried to stand on their toes and see past the firemen and the hoses. I was tired and I wished it would all be over. I realized then that the light was lessening, the faces on the lawn less distinct, and a new tone came into the noise; the voices inside were surer, less sharp, almost pleased, and the voices outside were lower, and disappointed. \u201cIt\u2019s going out,\u201d someone said. \u201cUnder control,\u201d another voice added.\u201cDid a lot of damage, though.\u201d There was laughter. \u201cSure made a mess of the old place.\u201d \u201cShould of burned it down years ago.\u201d \u201cAnd them in it.\u201d They mean us, I thought, Constance and me. \u201cSay\u2014anybody seen them?\u201d \u201cNo such luck. Firemen threw them out.\u201d \u201cToo bad.\u201d The light was almost gone. The people outside stood now in shadows, their faces narrowed and dark, with only the headlights of the cars to light them; I saw the flash of a smile, and somewhere else a hand raised to wave, and the voices went on regretfully. \u201cJust about over.\u201d \u201cPretty good fire.\u201d Jim Donell came through the front door. Everyone knew him because of his size and his hat saying CHIEF. \u201cSay, Jim,\u201d someone called, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you let it burn?\u201d He lifted both his hands to make everyone be quiet. \u201cFire\u2019s all out, folks,\u201d he said. Very carefully he put up his hands and took off his hat saying CHIEF and while everyone watched he walked slowly down the steps and over to the fire engine and set his hat down on the front seat. Then he bent down, searching thoughtfully, and finally, while everyone watched, he took up a rock. In complete silence he turned slowly and then raised his arm and smashed the rock through one of the great tall windows of our mother\u2019s drawing room. A wall of laughter rose and grew behind him and then, first the boys on the steps and then the other men and at last the women and the smaller children, they moved like a wave at our house. \u201cConstance,\u201d I said, \u201cConstance,\u201d but she had her hands over her eyes. The other of the drawing-room windows crashed, this time from inside, and I saw that it had been shattered by the lamp which always stood by Constance\u2019s chair in the drawing room. Above it all, most horrible, was the laughter. I saw one of the Dresden figurines thrown and break against the porch rail, and the other fell unbroken and rolled along the grass. I heard Constance\u2019s harp go over with a musical cry, and a sound which I knew was a chair being smashed against the wall. \u201cListen,\u201d said Charles from somewhere, \u201cwill a couple of you guyshelp me with this safe?\u201d Then, through the laughter, someone began, \u201cMerricat, said Constance, would you like a cup of tea?\u201d It was rhythmic and insistent. I am on the moon, I thought, please let me be on the moon. Then I heard the sound of dishes smashing and at that minute realized that we stood outside the tall windows of the dining room and they were coming very close. \u201cConstance,\u201d I said, \u201cwe have to run.\u201d She shook her head, her hands over her face. \u201cThey\u2019ll find us in a minute. Please, Constance dearest; run with me.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, and from just inside the dining-room window a shout went up: \u201cMerricat, said Constance, would you like to go to sleep?\u201d and I pulled Constance away a second before the window went; I thought a chair had been thrown through it, perhaps the dining-room chair where our father used to sit and Charles used to sit. \u201cHurry,\u201d I said, no longer able to be quiet in all that noise, and pulling Constance by the hand I ran toward the steps. As we came into the light she threw Uncle Julian\u2019s shawl across her face to hide it. A little girl ran out of the front door carrying something, and her mother, behind her, caught her by the back of the dress and slapped her hands. \u201cDon\u2019t you put that stuff in your mouth,\u201d the mother screamed, and the little girl dropped a handful of Constance\u2019s spice cookies. \u201cMerricat, said Constance, would you like a cup of tea?\u201d \u201cMerricat, said Constance, would you like to go to sleep?\u201d \u201cOh, no, said Merricat, you\u2019ll poison me.\u201d We had to get down the steps and into the woods to be safe; it was not far but the headlights of the cars shone across the lawn. I wondered if Constance would slip and fall, running through the light, but we had to get to the woods and there was no other way. We hesitated near the steps, neither one of us quite daring to go farther, but the windows were broken and inside they were throwing our dishes and our glasses and our silverware and even the pots Constance used in cooking; I wondered if my stool in the corner of the kitchen had been smashed yet. While we stood still for a last minute, a car came up the driveway, and another behind it; they swung to a stop in front of the house, sending more light onto the lawn. \u201cWhat the holy devil is going on here?\u201d Jim Clarke said, rolling out of the first car, and Helen Clarke, on the other side, opened her mouth and stared. Shouting andpushing, and not seeing us at all, Jim Clarke made his way through our door and into our house, \u201cWhat the holy goddam devil is going on here?\u201d he kept saying and outside Helen Clarke never saw us, but only stared at our house. \u201cCrazy fools,\u201d Jim Clarke yelled inside, \u201ccrazy drunken fools.\u201d Dr. Levy came out of the second car and hurried toward the house. \u201cHas everyone gone crazy in here?\u201d Jim Clarke was saying from inside, and there was a shout of laughter. \u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201d someone inside screamed, and they laughed. \u201cOught to bring it down brick by brick,\u201d someone said inside. The doctor came up the steps running, and pushed us aside without looking. \u201cWhere is Julian Blackwood?\u201d he asked a woman in the doorway, and the woman said, \u201cDown in the boneyard ten feet deep.\u201d It was time; I took Constance tightly by the hand, and we started carefully down the steps. I would not run yet because I was afraid that Constance might fall, so I brought her slowly down the steps; no one could see us yet except Helen Clarke and she stared at the house. Behind us I heard Jim Clarke shouting; he was trying to make the people leave our house, and before we reached the bottom step there were voices behind us. \u201cThere they are,\u201d someone shouted and I think it was Stella. \u201cThere they are, there they are, there they are,\u201d and I started to run but Constance stumbled and then they were all around us, pushing and laughing and trying to get close to see. Constance held Uncle Julian\u2019s shawl across her face so they could not look at her, and for a minute we stood very still, pressed together by the feeling of people all around us. \u201cPut them back in the house and start the fire all over again.\u201d \u201cWe fixed things up nice for you girls, just like you always wanted it.\u201d \u201cMerricat, said Constance, would you like a cup of tea?\u201d For one terrible minute I thought that they were going to join hands and dance around us, singing. I saw Helen Clarke far away, pressed hard against the side of her car; she was crying and saying something and even though I could not hear her through the noise I knew she was saying \u201cI want to go home, please, I want to go home.\u201d \u201cMerricat, said Constance, would you like to go to sleep?\u201d They were trying not to touch us; whenever I turned they fell back a little; once, between two shoulders I saw Harler of the junk yard wandering across the porch of our house, picking up things and setting them to one side in a pile. I moved a little, holding Constance\u2019s hand tight, and as they fell back we ran suddenly, going toward the trees, but Jim Donell\u2019s wife and Mrs. Mueller came in front of us, laughing andholding out their arms, and we stopped. I turned, and gave Constance a little pull, and we ran, but Stella and the Harris boys crossed in front of us, laughing, and the Harris boys shouting \u201cDown in the boneyard ten feet deep,\u201d and we stopped. Then I turned toward the house, running again with Constance pulled behind me, and Elbert the grocer and his greedy wife were there, holding their hands to halt us, almost dancing together, and we stopped. I went then to the side, and Jim Donell stepped in front of us, and we stopped. \u201cOh, no, said Merricat, you\u2019ll poison me,\u201d Jim Donell said politely, and they came around us again, circling and keeping carefully out of reach. \u201cMerricat, said Constance, would you like to go to sleep?\u201d Over it all was the laughter, almost drowning the singing and the shouting and the howling of the Harris boys. \u201cMerricat, said Constance, would you like a cup of tea?\u201d Constance held to me with one hand and with the other hand she kept Uncle Julian\u2019s shawl across her face. I saw an opening in the circle around us, and ran again for the trees, but all the Harris boys were there, one on the ground with laughter, and we stopped. I turned again and ran for the house but Stella came forward and we stopped. Constance was stumbling, and I wondered if we were going to fall onto the ground in front of them, lying there where they might step on us in their dancing, and I stood still; I could not possibly let Constance fall in front of them. \u201cThat\u2019s all now,\u201d Jim Clarke said from the porch. His voice was not loud, but they all heard. \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d he said. There was a small polite silence, and then someone said, \u201cDown in the boneyard ten feet deep,\u201d and the laughter rose. \u201cListen to me,\u201d Jim Clarke said, raising his voice, \u201clisten to me. Julian Blackwood is dead.\u201d Then they were quiet at last. After a minute Charles Blackwood said from the crowd around us, \u201cDid she kill him?\u201d They went back from us, moving slowly in small steps, withdrawing, until there was a wide clear space around us and Constance standing clearly with Uncle Julian\u2019s shawl across her face. \u201cDid she kill him?\u201d Charles Blackwood asked again. \u201cShe did not,\u201d said the doctor, standing in the doorway of our house. \u201cJulian died as I have always known he would; he has been waiting a long time.\u201d \u201cNow go quietly,\u201d Jim Clarke said. He began to take people by the shoulders, pushing a little at their backs, turning them toward theircars and the driveway. \u201cGo quickly,\u201d he said, \u201cThere has been a death in this house.\u201d It was so quiet, in spite of many people moving across the grass and going away, that I heard Helen Clarke say, \u201cPoor Julian.\u201d I took a cautious step toward the darkness, pulling Constance a little so that she followed me. \u201cHeart,\u201d the doctor said on the porch, and I went another step. No one turned to look at us. Car doors slammed softly and motors started. I looked back once. A little group was standing around the doctor on the steps. Most of the lights were turned away, heading down the driveway. When I felt the shadows of the trees fall on us, I moved quickly; one last step and we were inside. Pulling Constance, I hurried under the trees, in the darkness; when I felt my feet leave the grass of the lawn and touch the soft mossy ground of the path through the woods and knew that the trees had closed in around us I stopped and put my arms around Constance. \u201cIt\u2019s all over,\u201d I told her, and held her tight. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I said, \u201call right now.\u201d I knew my way in the darkness or in the light. I thought once how good it was that I had straightened my hiding place and freshened it, so it would now be pleasant for Constance. I would cover her with leaves, like children in a story, and keep her safe and warm. Perhaps I would sing to her or tell her stories; I would bring her bright fruits and berries and water in a leaf cup. Someday we would go to the moon. I found the entrance to my hiding place and led Constance in and took her to the corner where there was a fresh pile of leaves and a blanket. I pushed her gently until she sat down and I took Uncle Julian\u2019s shawl away from her and covered her with it. A little purr came from the corner and I knew that Jonas had been waiting here for me. I put branches across the entrance; even if they came with lights they would not see us. It was not entirely dark; I could see the shadow that was Constance and when I put my head back I saw two or three stars, shining from far away between the leaves and the branches and down onto my head. One of our mother\u2019s Dresden figurines is broken, I thought, and I said aloud to Constance, \u201cI am going to put death in all their food and watch them die.\u201d Constance stirred, and the leaves rustled. \u201cThe way you did before?\u201d she asked. It had never been spoken of between us, not once in six years. \u201cYes,\u201d I said after a minute, \u201cthe way I did before.\u201d9 Sometime during the night an ambulance came and took Uncle Julian away, and I wondered if they missed his shawl, which was wound around Constance as she slept. I saw the ambulance lights turning into the driveway, with the small red light on top, and I heard the distant sounds of Uncle Julian\u2019s leaving, the voices speaking gently because they were in the presence of the dead, and the doors opening and closing. They called to us two or three times, perhaps to ask if they might have Uncle Julian, but their voices were subdued and no one came into the woods. I sat by the creek, wishing that I had been kinder to Uncle Julian. Uncle Julian had believed that I was dead, and now he was dead himself; bow your heads to our beloved Mary Katherine, I thought, or you will be dead. The water moved sleepily in the darkness and I wondered what kind of a house we would have now. Perhaps the fire had destroyed everything and we would go back tomorrow and find that the past six years had been burned and they were waiting for us, sitting around the dining-room table waiting for Constance to bring them their dinner. Perhaps we would find ourselves in the Rochester house, or living in the village or on a houseboat on the river or in a tower on top of a hill; perhaps the fire might be persuaded to reverse itself and abandon our house and destroy the village instead; perhaps the villagers were all dead now. Perhaps the village was really a great game board, with the squares neatly marked out, and I had been moved past the square which read \u201cFire; return to Start,\u201d and was now on the last few squares, with only one move to go to reach home. Jonas\u2019s fur smelled of smoke. Today was Helen Clarke\u2019s day to come to tea, but there would be no tea today, because we would have to neaten the house, although it was not the usual day for neatening the house. I wished that Constance had made sandwiches for us to bring down to the creek, and I wondered if Helen Clarke would try to come to tea even though the house was not ready. I decided that from now on I would not be allowed to hand tea cups. When it first began to get light I heard Constance stirring on the leaves and I went into my hiding place to be near her when she awakened. When she opened her eyes she looked first at the trees above her, and then at me and smiled. \u201cWe are on the moon at last,\u201d I told her, and she smiled.\u201cI thought I dreamed it all,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really happened,\u201d I said. \u201cPoor Uncle Julian.\u201d \u201cThey came in the night and took him away, and we stayed here on the moon.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad to be here,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you for bringing me.\u201d There were leaves in her hair and dirt on her face and Jonas, who had followed me into my hiding place, stared at her in surprise; he had never seen Constance with a dirty face before. For a minute she was quiet, no longer smiling, looking back at Jonas, realizing that she was dirty, and then she said, \u201cMerricat, what are we going to do?\u201d \u201cFirst we must neaten the house, even though it is not the usual day.\u201d \u201cThe house,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, Merricat.\u201d \u201cI had no dinner last night,\u201d I told her. \u201cOh, Merricat. \u201d She sat up and untangled herself quickly from Uncle Julian\u2019s shawl and the leaves; \u201cOh, Merricat, poor baby,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll hurry,\u201d and she scrambled to her feet. \u201cFirst you had better wash your face.\u201d She went to the creek and wet her handkerchief and scrubbed at her face while I shook out Uncle Julian\u2019s shawl and folded it, thinking how strange and backward everything was this morning; I had never touched Uncle Julian\u2019s shawl before. I already saw that the rules were going to be different, but it was odd to be folding Uncle Julian\u2019s shawl. Later, I thought, I would come back here to my hiding place and clean it, and put in fresh leaves. \u201cMerricat, you\u2019ll starve.\u201d \u201cWe have to watch,\u201d I said, taking her hand to slow her. \u201cWe have to go very quietly and carefully; some of them may still be around waiting.\u201d I went first down the path, walking silently, with Constance and Jonas behind me. Constance could not step as silently as I could, but she made very little sound and of course Jonas made no sound at all. I took the path that would bring us out of the woods at the back of the house, near the vegetable garden, and when I came to the edge of the woods I stopped and held Constance back while we looked carefully to see if there were any of them left. For one first minute we saw only the garden and the kitchen door, looking just as always, and then Constance gasped and said, \u201cOh, Merricat, \u201d with a little moan, and I held myself very still, because the top of our house was gone.I remembered that I had stood looking at our house with love yesterday, and I thought how it had always been so tall, reaching up into the trees. Today the house ended above the kitchen doorway in a nightmare of black and twisted wood; I saw part of a window frame still holding broken glass and I thought: that was my window; I looked out that window from my room. There was no one there, and no sound. We moved together very slowly toward the house, trying to understand its ugliness and ruin and shame. I saw that ash had drifted among the vegetable plants; the lettuce would have to be washed before I could eat it, and the tomatoes. No fire had come this way, but everything, the grass and the apple trees and the marble bench in Constance\u2019s garden, had an air of smokiness and everything was dirty. As we came closer to the house we saw more clearly that the fire had not reached the ground floor, but had had to be content with the bedrooms and the attic. Constance hesitated at the kitchen door, but she had opened it a thousand times before and it ought surely to recognize the touch of her hand, so she took the latch and lifted it. The house seemed to shiver when she opened the door, although one more draft could hardly chill it now. Constance had to push at the door to make it open, but no burned timber crashed down, and there was not, as I half thought there might be, a sudden rushing falling together, as a house, seemingly solid but really made only of ash, might dissolve at a touch. \u201cMy kitchen,\u201d Constance said. \u201cMy kitchen.\u201d She stood in the doorway, looking. I thought that we had somehow not found our way back correctly through the night, that we had somehow lost ourselves and come back through the wrong gap in time, or the wrong door, or the wrong fairy tale. Constance put her hand against the door frame to steady herself, and said again, \u201cMy kitchen, Merricat.\u201d \u201cMy stool is still there,\u201d I said. The obstacle which made the door hard to open was the kitchen table, turned on its side. I set it upright, and we went inside. Two of the chairs had been smashed, and the floor was horrible with broken dishes and glasses and broken boxes of food and paper torn from the shelves. Jars of jam and syrup and catsup had been shattered against the walls. The sink where Constance washed her dishes was filled with broken glass, as though glass after glass had been broken there methodically, one after another. Drawers of silverware and cooking ware had been pulled out and broken against the table and the walls,and silverware that had been in the house for generations of Blackwood wives was lying bent and scattered on the floor. Tablecloths and napkins hemmed by Blackwood women, and washed and ironed again and again, mended and cherished, had been ripped from the dining-room sideboard and dragged across the kitchen. It seemed that all the wealth and hidden treasure of our house had been found out and torn and soiled; I saw broken plates which had come from the top shelves in the cupboard, and our little sugar bowl with roses lay almost at my feet, handles gone. Constance bent down and picked up a silver spoon. \u201cThis was our grandmother\u2019s wedding pattern,\u201d she said, and set the spoon on the table. Then she said, \u201cThe preserves,\u201d and turned to the cellar door; it was closed and I hoped that perhaps they had not seen it, or had perhaps not had time to go down the stairs. Constance picked her way carefully across the floor and opened the cellar door and looked down. I thought of the jars and jars so beautifully preserved lying in broken sticky heaps in the cellar, but Constance went down a step or two and said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s all right; nothing here\u2019s been touched.\u201d She closed the cellar door again and made her way across to the sink to wash her hands and dry them on a dishtowel from the floor. \u201cFirst, your breakfast,\u201d she said. Jonas sat on the doorstep in the growing sunlight looking at the kitchen with astonishment; once he raised his eyes to me and I wondered if he thought that Constance and I had made this mess. I saw a cup not broken, and picked it up and set it on the table, and then thought to look for more things which might have escaped. I remembered that one of our mother\u2019s Dresden figurines had rolled safely onto the grass and I wondered if it had hidden successfully and preserved itself; I would look for it later. Nothing was orderly, nothing was planned; it was not like any other day. Once Constance went into the cellar and came back with her arms full. \u201cVegetable soup,\u201d she said, almost singing, \u201cand strawberry jam, and chicken soup, and pickled beef.\u201d She set the jars on the kitchen table and turned slowly, looking down at the floor. \u201cThere,\u201d she said at last, and went to a corner to pick up a small saucepan. Then on a sudden thought she set down the saucepan and made her way into the pantry. \u201cMerricat,\u201d she called with laughter, \u201cthey didn\u2019t find the flour in the barrel. Or the salt. Or the potatoes.\u201d They found the sugar, I thought. The floor was gritty, and almost alive under my feet, and I thought of course; of course they would go looking for the sugar and have a lovely time; perhaps they had thrownhandfuls of sugar at one another, screaming, \u201cBlackwood sugar, Blackwood sugar, want a taste?\u201d \u201cThey got to the pantry shelves,\u201d Constance went on, \u201cthe cereals and the spices and the canned food.\u201d I walked slowly around the kitchen, looking at the floor. I thought that they had probably tumbled things by the armload, because cans of food were scattered and bent as though they had been tossed into the air, and the boxes of cereal and tea and crackers had been trampled under foot and broken open. The tins of spices were all together, thrown into a corner unopened; I thought I could still smell the faint spicy scent of Constance\u2019s cookies and then saw some of them, crushed on the floor. Constance came out of the pantry carrying a loaf of bread. \u201cLook what they didn\u2019t find,\u201d she said, \u201cand there are eggs and milk and butter in the cooler.\u201d Since they had not found the cellar door they had not found the cooler just inside, and I was pleased that they had not discovered eggs to mix into the mess on the floor. At one time I found three unbroken chairs and set them where they belonged around the table. Jonas sat in my corner, on my stool, watching us. I drank chicken soup from a cup without a handle, and Constance washed a knife to spread butter on the bread. Although I did",

      "chapter_text": "not perceive it then, time and the orderly pattern of our old days had ended; I do not know when I found the three chairs and when I ate buttered bread, whether I had found the chairs and then eaten bread, or whether I had eaten first, or even done both at once. Once Constance turned suddenly and put down her knife; she started for the closed door to Uncle Julian\u2019s room and then turned back, smiling a little. \u201cI thought I heard him waking,\u201d she said, and sat down again. We had not yet been out of the kitchen. We still did not know how much house was left to us, or what we might find waiting beyond the closed doors into the dining room and the hall. We sat quietly in the kitchen, grateful for the chairs and the chicken soup and the sunlight coming through the doorway, not yet ready to go further. \u201cWhat will they do with Uncle Julian?\u201d I asked. \u201cThey will have a funeral,\u201d Constance said with sadness. \u201cDo you remember the others?\u201d \u201cI was in the orphanage.\u201d \u201cThey let me go to the funerals of the others. I can remember. They will have a funeral for Uncle Julian, and the Clarkes will go, and the Carringtons, and certainly little Mrs. Wright. They will tell each otherhow sorry they are. They will look to see if we are there.\u201d I felt them looking to see if we were there, and I shivered. \u201cThey will bury him with the others.\u201d \u201cI would like to bury something for Uncle Julian,\u201d I said. Constance was quiet, looking at her fingers which lay still and long on the table. \u201cUncle Julian is gone, and the others,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of our house is gone, Merricat; we are all that is left.\u201d \u201cJonas.\u201d \u201cJonas. We are going to lock ourselves in more securely than ever.\u201d \u201cBut today is the day Helen Clarke comes to tea.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNot again. Not here.\u201d As long as we sat quietly together in the kitchen it was possible to postpone seeing the rest of the house. The library books were still on their shelf, untouched, and I supposed that no one had wanted to touch books belonging to the library; there was a fine, after all, for destroying library property. Constance, who was always dancing, seemed now unwilling to move; she sat on at the kitchen table with her hands spread before her, not looking around at the destruction, and almost dreaming, as though she never believed that she had wakened this morning at all. \u201cWe must neaten the house,\u201d I said to her uneasily, and she smiled across at me. When I felt that I could not wait for her any longer I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to look,\u201d and got up and went to the dining-room door. She watched me, not moving. When I opened the door to the dining room there was a shocking smell of wetness and burned wood and destruction, and glass from the tall windows lay across the floor and the silver tea service had been swept off the sideboard and stamped into grotesque, unrecognizable shapes. Chairs were broken here, too; I remembered that they had taken up chairs and hurled them at windows and walls. I went through the dining room and into the front hall. The front door stood wide open and early sunlight lay in patterns along the floor of the hall, touching broken glass and torn cloth; after a minute I recognized the cloth as the drawing-room draperies which our mother had once had made up fourteen feet long. No one was outside; I stood in the open doorway and saw that the lawn was marked with the tires of cars and the feet which had danced, and where the hoses had gone there were puddles and mud. The front porch was littered, and I remembered the neat pile of partly broken furniture which Harler the junk dealer had set together last night. I wondered if he planned to come today with a truck and gather up everything he could, or if he hadonly put the pile together because he loved great piles of broken things and could not resist stacking junk wherever he found it. I waited in the doorway to be sure that no one was watching, and then I ran down the steps across the grass and found our mother\u2019s Dresden figurine unbroken where it had hidden against the roots of a bush; I thought to take it to Constance. She was still sitting quietly at the kitchen table, and when I put the Dresden figurine down before her she looked for a minute and then took it in her hands and held it against her cheek. \u201cIt was all my fault,\u201d she said. \u201cSomehow it was all my fault.\u201d \u201cI love you, Constance,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I love you, Merricat.\u201d \u201cAnd will you make that little cake for Jonas and me? Pink frosting, with gold leaves around the edge?\u201d She shook her head, and for a minute I thought she was not going to answer me, and then she took a deep breath, and stood up. \u201cFirst,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to clean this kitchen.\u201d \u201cWhat are you going to do with that?\u201d I asked her, touching the Dresden figurine with the very tip of my finger. \u201cPut it back where it belongs,\u201d she said, and I followed her as she opened the door to the hall and made her way down the hall to the drawing-room doorway. The hall was less littered than the rooms, because there had been less in it to smash, but there were fragments carried from the kitchen, and we stepped on spoons and dishes which had been thrown here. I was shocked when we came into the drawing room to see our mother\u2019s portrait looking down on us graciously while her drawing room lay destroyed around her. The white wedding-cake trim was blackened with smoke and soot and would never be clean again; I disliked seeing the drawing room even more than the kitchen or the dining room, because we had always kept it so tidy, and our mother had loved this room. I wondered which of them had pushed over Constance\u2019s harp and I remembered that I had heard it cry out as it fell. The rose brocade on the chairs was torn and dirty, smudged with the marks of wet feet that had kicked at the chairs and stamped on the sofa. The windows were broken here too, and with the drapes torn down we were clearly visible from outside. \u201cI think I can close the shutters,\u201d I said, as Constance hesitated in the doorway, unwilling to come further into the room. I stepped out onto the porch through the broken window, thinking that no one had ever come this way before, and found that I could unhook the shutterseasily. The shutters were as tall as the windows; originally it was intended that a man with a ladder would close the shutters when the summers were ended and the family went away to a city house, but so many years had passed since the shutters were closed that the hooks had rusted and I needed only to shake the heavy shutters to pull the hooks away from the house. I swung the shutters closed, but I could only reach the lower bolt to hold them; there were two more bolts high above my head; perhaps some night I might come out here with a ladder, but the lower bolt would have to hold them now. After I had closed the shutters on both tall drawing-room windows I went along the porch and in, formally, through the front door and into the drawing room where Constance stood in dimness now, without the sunlight. Constance went to the mantel and set the Dresden figurine in its place below the portrait of our mother and for one quick minute the great shadowy room came back together again, as it should be, and then fell apart forever. We had to walk carefully because of the broken things on the floor. Our father\u2019s safe lay just inside the drawing-room door, and I laughed and even Constance smiled, because it had not been opened and it had clearly not been possible to carry it any farther than this. \u201cFoolishness,\u201d Constance said, and touched the safe with her toe. Our mother had always been pleased when people admired her drawing room, but now no one could come to the windows and look in, and no one would ever see it again. Constance and I closed the drawing-room door behind us and never opened it afterwards. Constance waited just inside the front door while I went onto the porch again and closed the shutters over the tall dining-room windows, and then I came inside and we shut and locked the front door and we were safe. The hall was dark, with two narrow lines of sunlight coming through the two narrow glass panels set on either side of the door; we could look outside through the glass, but no one could see in, even by putting their eyes up close, because the hall inside was dark. Above us the stairs were black and led into blackness or burned rooms with, incredibly, tiny spots of sky showing through. Until now, the roof had always hidden us from the sky, but I did not think that there was any way we could be vulnerable from above, and closed my mind against the thought of silent winged creatures coming out of the trees above to perch on the broken burnt rafters of our house, peering down. I thought it might be wise to barricade the stairs by putting something\u2014 a broken chair, perhaps\u2014across. A mattress, soaked and dirty, layhalfway down the stairs; this was where they had stood with the hoses and fought the fire back and out. I stood at the foot of the stairs, looking up, wondering where our house had gone, the walls and the floors and the beds and the boxes of things in the attic; our father\u2019s watch was burned away, and our mother\u2019s tortoise-shell dressing set. I could feel a breath of air on my cheek; it came from the sky I could see, but it smelled of smoke and ruin. Our house was a castle, turreted and open to the sky. \u201cCome back to the kitchen,\u201d Constance said. \u201cI can\u2019t stay out here.\u201d Like children hunting for shells, or two old ladies going through dead leaves looking for pennies, we shuffled along the kitchen floor with our feet, turning over broken trash to find things which were still whole, and useful. When we had been along and across and diagonally through the kitchen we had gathered together a little pile of practical things on the kitchen table, and there was quite enough for the two of us. There were two cups with handles, and several without, and half a dozen plates, and three bowls. We had been able to rescue all the cans of food undamaged, and the cans of spice went neatly back onto their shelf. We found most of the silverware and straightened most of it as well as we could and put it back into its proper drawers. Since every Blackwood bride had brought her own silverware and china and linen into the house we had always had dozens of butter knives and soup ladles and cake servers; our mother\u2019s best silverware had been in a tarnish-proof box in the dining-room sideboard, but they had found it and scattered it on the floor. One of our whole cups was green with a pale yellow inside, and Constance said that one could be mine. \u201cI never saw anyone use it before,\u201d she said. \u201cI suppose a grandmother or a great-great-aunt brought that set to the house as her wedding china. There once were plates to match.\u201d The cup which Constance chose was white with orange flowers, and one of the plates matched that. \u201cI remember when we used those dishes,\u201d Constance said; \u201cthey were the everyday china when I was very small. The china we used for best then was white, with gold edges. Then Mother bought new best china and the white and gold china was used for everyday and these flowered dishes went onto the pantry shelf with the other half-broken sets. These last few years I have always used Mother\u2019s everyday china, except when Helen Clarke came to tea. We will take our meals like ladies,\u201d she said, \u201cusing cups with handles.\u201dWhen we had taken out everything we wanted and could use, Constance got the heavy broom and swept all the rubble into the dining room. \u201cNow we won\u2019t have to look at it,\u201d she said. She swept the hall clear so we could go from the kitchen to the front door without passing through the dining room, and then we closed all the doors to the dining room and never opened them again. I thought of the Dresden figurine standing small and courageous under our mother\u2019s portrait in the dark drawing room and I remembered that we would never dust it again. Before Constance swept away the torn cloth that had been the drawing-room drapes I asked her to cut me off a piece of the cord which had once drawn them open and shut, and she cut me a piece with a gold tassel on the end; I wondered if it might be the right thing to bury for Uncle Julian. When we had finished and Constance had scrubbed the kitchen floor our house looked clean and new; from the front door to the kitchen door everything was clear and swept. So many things were gone from the kitchen that it looked bare, but Constance put our cups and plates and bowls on a shelf, and found a pan to give Jonas milk, and we were quite safe. The front door was locked, and the kitchen door was locked and bolted, and we were sitting at the kitchen table drinking milk from our two cups and Jonas was drinking from his pan when a knocking started on the front door. Constance ran to the cellar, and I stopped just long enough to be sure that the kitchen door was bolted, and then followed her. We sat on the cellar stairs in the darkness, and listened. Far away, at the front door, the knocking went on and on, and then a voice called, \u201cConstance? Mary Katherine?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Helen Clarke,\u201d Constance said in a whisper. \u201cDo you think she has come for her tea?\u201d \u201cNo. Never again.\u201d As we had both known she would, she came around the house, calling us. When she knocked on the kitchen door we held our breath, neither of us moving, because the top half of the kitchen door was glass, and we knew she could see in, but we were safely on the cellar stairs and she could not open the door. \u201cConstance? Mary Katherine? Are you in there?\u201d She shook the door handle as people do when they want a door to open and think to catch it unaware and slip in before the lock can hold. \u201cJim,\u201d she said, \u201cI know they\u2019re in there. I can see something cooking on the stove. You\u2019ve got to open the door,\u201d she said, raising her voice. \u201cConstance, come and talk to me; I want to see you. Jim,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019re in there andthey can hear me, I know it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure they can hear you,\u201d Jim Clarke said. \u201cThey can probably hear you in the village.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m sure they misunderstood the people last night; I\u2019m sure Constance was upset, and I must tell them that nobody meant any harm. Constance, listen to me, please. We want you and Mary Katherine to come to our house until we can decide what to do with you. Everything\u2019s all right, really it is; we\u2019re going to forget all about it.\u201d \u201cDo you think she will push over the house?\u201d I whispered to Constance, and Constance shook her head wordlessly. \u201cJim, do you think you could break down the door?\u201d \u201cCertainly not. Leave them alone, Helen, they\u2019ll come out when they\u2019re ready.\u201d \u201cBut Constance takes these things so seriously. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s frightened now.\u201d \u201cLeave them alone.\u201d \u201cThey cannot be left alone, that is absolutely the worst possible thing for them. I want them out of there and home with me where I can take care of them.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to want to come,\u201d Jim Clarke said. \u201cConstance? Constance? I know you\u2019re in there; come and open the door.\u201d I was thinking that we might very well put a cloth or a piece of cardboard over the window in the kitchen door; it simply would not do to have Helen Clarke constantly peering in to watch pots cooking on the stove. We could pin the curtains together across the kitchen windows, and perhaps if the windows were all covered we could sit quietly at the table when Helen Clarke came pounding outside and not have to hide on the cellar stairs. \u201cLet\u2019s leave,\u201d Jim Clarke said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to answer you.\u201d \u201cBut I want to take them home with me.\u201d \u201cWe did what we could. We\u2019ll come back another time, when they\u2019ll feel more like seeing you.\u201d \u201cConstance? Constance, please answer me.\u201d Constance sighed, and tapped her fingers irritably and almost noiselessly on the stair rail. \u201cI wish she\u2019d hurry,\u201d she said into my ear, \u201cmy soup is going to boil over.\u201d Helen Clarke called again and again, going back around the house to their car, calling \u201cConstance? Constance?\u201d as though we might be somewhere in the woods, up a tree perhaps, or under the lettuceleaves, or waiting to spring out at her from behind a bush. When we heard their car start, distantly, we came up out of the cellar and Constance turned off her soup and I went along the hall to the front door to be sure they had gone and that the door was safely locked. I saw their car turn out of the driveway and thought I could still hear Helen Clarke calling \u201cConstance? Constance?\u201d \u201cShe certainly wanted her tea,\u201d I said to Constance when I came back to the kitchen. \u201cWe have only two cups with handles,\u201d Constance said. \u201cShe will never take tea here again.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing Uncle Julian\u2019s gone, or one of us would have to use a broken cup. Are you going to neaten Uncle Julian\u2019s room?\u201d \u201cMerricat.\u201d Constance turned from the stove to look at me. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve neatened the house. We\u2019ve had food. We\u2019ve hidden from Helen Clarke. What are we going to do?\u201d \u201cWhere are we going to sleep? How are we going to know what time it is? What will we wear for clothes?\u201d \u201cWhy do we need to know what time it is?\u201d \u201cOur food won\u2019t last forever, even the preserves.\u201d \u201cWe can sleep in my hiding place by the creek.\u201d \u201cNo. That\u2019s all right for hiding, but you must have a real bed.\u201d \u201cI saw a mattress on the stairs. From my own old bed, perhaps. We can pull it down and clean it and dry it in the sun. One corner is burned.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said Constance. We went together to the stairs and took hold of the mattress awkwardly; it was unpleasantly wet and dirty. We dragged it, pulling together, along the hall, with little scraps of wood and glass coming with it, and got it across Constance\u2019s clean kitchen floor to the kitchen door. Before unlocking the door I looked out carefully, and even when the door was opened I went out first to look around in every direction, but it was safe. We dragged the mattress out onto the lawn, and put it in the sun near our mother\u2019s marble bench. \u201cUncle Julian used to sit right here,\u201d I said. \u201cIt would be a good day, today, for Uncle Julian to sit in the sun.\u201d \u201cI hope he was warm when he died. Perhaps he remembered the sun for a minute.\u201d \u201cI had his shawl; I hope he didn\u2019t wish for it. Merricat, I am going to plant something here, where he used to sit.\u201d \u201cI am going to bury something for him. What will you plant?\u201d\u201cA flower.\u201d Constance leaned, and touched the grass softly. \u201cSome kind of a yellow flower.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to look funny, right in the middle of the lawn.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll know why it\u2019s there, and no one else will ever see it.\u201d \u201cAnd I will bury something yellow, to keep Uncle Julian warm.\u201d \u201cFirst, however, my lazy Merricat, you will get a pot of water and scrub that mattress clean. And I will wash the kitchen floor again.\u201d We were going to be very happy, I thought. There were a great many things to do, and a whole new pattern of days to arrange, but I thought we were going to be very happy. Constance was pale, and still saddened by what they had done to her kitchen, but she had scrubbed every shelf, and washed the table again and again, and washed the windows and the floor. Our dishes were bravely on their shelf, and the cans and unbroken boxes of food we had rescued made a substantial row in the pantry. \u201cI could train Jonas to bring back rabbits for stew,\u201d I told her, and she laughed, and Jonas looked back at her blandly. \u201cThat cat is so used to living on cream and rum cakes and buttered eggs that I doubt if he could catch a grasshopper,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could care for a grasshopper stew.\u201d \u201cAt any rate, right now I am making an onion pie.\u201d While Constance washed the kitchen I found a heavy cardboard carton which I took apart carefully, and so had several large pieces of cardboard to cover the glass window in the kitchen door. The hammer and the nails were in the tool shed where Charles Blackwood had put them after trying to mend the broken step, and I nailed cardboard across the kitchen door until the glass was completely covered and no one could see in. I nailed more cardboard across the two kitchen windows, and the kitchen was dark, but safe. \u201cIt would be safer to let the kitchen windows get dirty,\u201d I told Constance, but she was shocked, and said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t live in a house with dirty windows.\u201d When we had finished the kitchen was very clean but could not sparkle because there was so little light, and I knew that Constance was not pleased. She loved sunshine and brightness and cooking in a light lovely kitchen. \u201cWe can keep the door open,\u201d I said, \u201cif we watch carefully all the time. We\u2019ll hear if any cars stop in front of the house. When I can,\u201d I said, \u201cI will try to think of a way to build barricades along the sides of the house so no one will be able to come around here to the back.\u201d \u201cI am sure Helen Clarke will try again.\u201d\u201cAt any rate she cannot look in now.\u201d The afternoon was drawing in; even with the door open the sunlight came only a short way across the floor, and Jonas came to Constance at the stove, asking for his supper. The kitchen was warm and comfortable and familiar and clean. It would be nice to have a fireplace in here, I thought; we could sit beside a fire, and then I thought no, we have already had a fire. \u201cI will go and make sure that the front door is locked,\u201d I said. The front door was locked and no one was outside. When I came back into the kitchen Constance said, \u201cTomorrow I will clean Uncle Julian\u2019s room. We have so little house left that it should all be very clean.\u201d \u201cWill you sleep in there? In Uncle Julian\u2019s bed?\u201d \u201cNo, Merricat. I want you to sleep in there. It\u2019s the only bed we have.\u201d \u201cI am not allowed in Uncle Julian\u2019s room.\u201d She was quiet for a minute, looking at me curiously, and then asked, \u201cEven though Uncle Julian\u2019s gone, Merricat?\u201d \u201cBesides, I found the mattress, and cleaned it, and it came from my bed. I want it on the floor in my corner.\u201d \u201cSilly Merricat. Anyway, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll both have the floor tonight. The mattress will not dry before tomorrow, and Uncle Julian\u2019s bed is not clean.\u201d \u201cI can bring branches from my hiding place, and leaves.\u201d \u201cOn my clean kitchen floor?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get the blanket, though, and Uncle Julian\u2019s shawl.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going out? Now? All that way?\u201d \u201cNo one\u2019s outside,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost dark and I can go very safely. If anyone comes, close the door and lock it; if I see that the door is closed I will wait by the creek until I can come safely home. And I will take Jonas for protection.\u201d I ran all the way to the creek, but Jonas was faster, and was waiting for me when I got to my hiding place. It was good to run, and good to come back again to our house and see the kitchen door standing open and the warm light inside. When Jonas and I came in I shut the door and bolted it and we were ready for the night. \u201cIt\u2019s a good dinner,\u201d Constance said, warm and happy from cooking. \u201cCome and sit down, Merricat.\u201d With the door shut she had had to turn on the ceiling light, and our dishes on the table were neatly set. \u201cTomorrow I will try to polish the silverware,\u201d she said, \u201cand we mustbring in things from the garden.\u201d \u201cThe lettuce is full of ashes.\u201d \u201cTomorrow, too,\u201d Constance said, looking at the black squares of cardboard which covered the windows, \u201cI am going to try to think of some kind of curtains to hide your cardboard.\u201d \u201cTomorrow I will barricade the sides of the house. Tomorrow Jonas will catch us a rabbit. Tomorrow I will guess for you what time it is.\u201d Far away, in the front of the house, a car stopped, and we were silent, looking at one another; now, I thought, now we will know how safe we are, and I got up and made sure that the kitchen door was bolted; I could not see out through the cardboard and I was sure that they could not see in. The knocking started at the front door, but there was no time to make sure that the front door was locked. They knocked only for a moment, as though certain that we would not be in the front of the house, and then we heard them stumbling in the darkness as they tried to find their way around the side of the house to the back. I heard Jim Clarke\u2019s voice, and another which I remembered was the voice of Dr. Levy. \u201cCan\u2019t see a thing,\u201d Jim Clarke said. \u201cBlack as sin out here.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a crack of light at one of the windows.\u201d Which one, I wondered; which window still showed a crack? \u201cThey\u2019re in there, all right,\u201d Jim Clarke said. \u201cNo place else they could be.\u201d \u201cI just want to know if they\u2019re hurt, or sick; don\u2019t like to think of them shut up in there needing help.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m supposed to bring them home with me,\u201d Jim Clarke said. They came to the back door; their voices were directly outside, and Constance reached out her hand across the table to me; if it seemed that they might be able to look in we could run together for the cellar. \u201cDamn place is all boarded up,\u201d Jim Clarke said, and I thought, good, oh, that\u2019s good. I had forgotten that there would be real boards in the tool shed; I never thought of anything but cardboard which is much too weak. \u201cMiss Blackwood?\u201d the doctor called, and one of them knocked on the door. \u201cMiss Blackwood? It\u2019s Dr. Levy.\u201d \u201cAnd Jim Clarke. Helen\u2019s husband. Helen\u2019s very worried about you.\u201d \u201cAre you hurt? Sick? Do you need help?\u201d \u201cHelen wants you to come to our house; she\u2019s waiting there for you.\u201d \u201cListen,\u201d the doctor said, and I thought he had his face up very close to the glass, almost touching it. He talked in a very friendly voice, andquietly. \u201cListen, no one\u2019s going to hurt you. We\u2019re your friends. We came all the way over here to help you and make sure you were all right and we don\u2019t want to bother you. As a matter of fact, we promise not to bother you at all, ever again, if you\u2019ll just once say that you\u2019re well and safe. Just one word.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t just let people go on worrying and worrying about you,\u201d Jim Clarke said. \u201cJust one word,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cAll you have to do is say you\u2019re all right.\u201d They waited; I could feel them pressing their faces close to the glass, longing to see inside. Constance looked at me across the table and smiled a little, and I smiled back; our safeguards were good and they could not see in. \u201cListen,\u201d the doctor said, and he raised his voice a little; \u201clisten, Julian\u2019s funeral is tomorrow. We thought you\u2019d want to know.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of flowers already,\u201d Jim Clarke said. \u201cYou\u2019d be really pleased to see all the flowers. We sent flowers, and the Wrights, and the Carringtons. I think you\u2019d feel a little different about your friends if you could see the flowers we all sent Julian.\u201d I wondered why we would feel different if we saw who sent Uncle Julian flowers. Certainly Uncle Julian buried in flowers, swarmed over by flowers, would not resemble the Uncle Julian we had seen every day. Perhaps masses of flowers would warm Uncle Julian dead; I tried to think of Uncle Julian dead and could only remember him asleep. I thought of the Clarkes and the Carringtons and the Wrights pouring armfuls of flowers down onto poor old Uncle Julian, helplessly dead. \u201cYou\u2019re not gaining anything by driving away your friends, you know. Helen said to tell you\u2014\u201d \u201cListen.\u201d I could feel them pushing against the door. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to bother you. Just tell us, are you all right?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not going to keep coming, you know. There\u2019s a limit to how much friends can take.\u201d Jonas yawned. In silence Constance turned, slowly and carefully, back to face her place at the table, and took up a buttered biscuit and took a tiny silent bite. I wanted to laugh, and put my hands over my mouth; Constance eating a biscuit silently was funny, like a doll pretending to eat. \u201c Damn it,\u201d Jim Clarke said. He knocked on the door. \u201c Damn it,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the last time,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cwe know you\u2019re in there; for thelast time will you just\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, come away,\u201d Jim Clarke said. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth all the yelling.\u201d \u201cListen,\u201d the doctor said, and I thought he had his mouth against the door, \u201cone of these days you\u2019re going to need help. You\u2019ll be sick, or hurt. You\u2019ll need help. Then you\u2019ll be quick enough to\u2014\u201d \u201cLeave them be,\u201d Jim Clarke said. \u201cCome on.\u201d I heard their footsteps going around the side of the house and wondered if they were tricking us, pretending to walk away and then coming silently back to stand without sound outside the door, waiting. I thought of Constance silently eating a biscuit inside and Jim Clarke silently listening outside and a little cold chill went up my back; perhaps there would never be noise in the world again. Then the car started at the front of the house and we heard it drive away and Constance put her fork down on her plate with a little crash and I breathed again and said, \u201cWhere have they got Uncle Julian, do you suppose?\u201d \u201cAt that same place,\u201d Constance said absently, \u201cin the city. Merricat,\u201d she said, looking up suddenly. \u201cYes, Constance?\u201d \u201cI want to say I\u2019m sorry. I was wicked last night.\u201d I was still and cold, looking at her and remembering. \u201cI was very wicked,\u201d she said. \u201cI never should have reminded you of why they all died.\u201d \u201cThen don\u2019t remind me now.\u201d I could not move my hand to reach over and take hers. \u201cI wanted you to forget about it. I never wanted to speak about it, ever, and I\u2019m sorry I did.\u201d \u201cI put it in the sugar.\u201d \u201cI know. I knew then.\u201d \u201cYou never used sugar.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cSo I put it in the sugar.\u201d Constance sighed. \u201cMerricat,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ll never talk about it again. Never.\u201d I was chilled, but she smiled at me kindly and it was all right. \u201cI love you, Constance,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I love you, my Merricat.\u201d Jonas sat on the floor and slept on the floor and I thought it ought not to be so difficult for me. Constance should have had leaves and softmoss under her blanket but we could not dirty the kitchen floor again. I put my blanket in the corner near my stool because it was the place I knew best, and Jonas got up onto the stool and sat there, looking down on me. Constance lay on the floor near the stove; it was dark, but I could see the paleness of her face across the kitchen. \u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d I asked her, and she laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time in",

      "chapter_text": "this kitchen,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I never before tried lying on its floor. I\u2019ve taken such good care of it that it has to make me welcome, I think.\u201d \u201cTomorrow we bring in lettuce.\u201d10 Slowly the pattern of our days grew, and shaped itself into a happy life. In the mornings when I awakened I would go at once down the hall to make sure the front door was locked. We were most active in the very early morning because no one was ever around. We had not realized that, with the gates opened and the path exposed to public use, the children would come; one morning I stood beside the front door, looking out through the narrow pane of glass, and saw children playing on our front lawn. Perhaps the parents had sent them to explore the way and make sure it was navigable, or perhaps children can never resist playing anywhere; they seemed a little uneasy playing in front of our house, and their voices were subdued. I thought that perhaps they were only pretending to play, because they were children and were supposed to play, but perhaps they were actually sent here to look for us, thinly disguised as children. They were not really convincing, I decided as I watched them; they moved gracelessly, and never once glanced, that I could see, at our house. I wondered how soon they would creep onto the porch, and press their small faces against the shutters, trying to see through cracks. Constance came up behind me and looked out over my shoulder. \u201cThey are the children of the strangers,\u201d I told her. \u201cThey have no faces.\u201d \u201cThey have eyes.\u201d \u201cPretend they are birds. They can\u2019t see us. They don\u2019t know it yet, they don\u2019t want to believe it, but they won\u2019t ever see us again.\u201d \u201cI suppose that now they\u2019ve come once, they\u2019ll come again.\u201d \u201cAll the strangers will come, but they can\u2019t see inside. And now may I please have my breakfast?\u201d The kitchen was always dark in the mornings until I unbolted the kitchen door and opened it to let the sunlight in. Then Jonas went to sit on the step and bathe and Constance sang while she made our breakfast. After breakfast I sat on the step with Jonas while Constance washed the kitchen. Barricading the sides of the house had been easier than I expected; I managed it in one night with Constance holding a flashlight for me. At either side of our house there was a spot where the trees and bushes grew close to the house, sheltering the back and narrowing the path which was the only way around. I brought piece after piece from the pile of junk Mr. Harler had made on our front porch, and heaped thebroken boards and furniture across the narrowest spot. It would not really keep anyone out, of course; the children could climb over it easily, but if anyone did try to get past there would be enough noise and falling of broken boards to give us plenty of time to close and bolt the kitchen door. I had found some boards around the tool shed, and nailed them rudely across the glass of the kitchen door, but I disliked putting them across the sides of the house as a barricade, where anyone might see them and know how clumsily I built. Perhaps, I told myself, I might try my hand at mending the broken step. \u201cWhat are you laughing about now?\u201d Constance asked me. \u201cI am thinking that we are on the moon, but it is not quite as I supposed it would be.\u201d \u201cIt is a very happy place, though.\u201d Constance was bringing breakfast to the table: scrambled eggs and toasted biscuits and blackberry jam she had made some golden summer. \u201cWe ought to bring in as much food as we can,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to think of the garden waiting there for us to come and gather growing things. And I\u2019d feel much better if we had more food put securely away in the house.\u201d \u201cI will go on my winged horse and bring you cinnamon and thyme, emeralds and clove, cloth of gold and cabbages.\u201d \u201cAnd rhubarb.\u201d We were able to leave the kitchen door open when we went down to the vegetable garden, because we could see clearly whether anyone was approaching my barricades and run back to the house if we needed to. I carried the basket and we brought back lettuce, still grey with ash, and radishes, and tomatoes and cucumbers and, later, berries, and melons. Usually I ate fruit and vegetables still moist from the ground and the air, but I disliked eating anything while it was still dirty with the ash from our burned house. Most of the dirt and the soot had blown away and the air around the garden was fresh and clean, but the smoke was in the ground and I thought it would always be there. As soon as we were safely settled Constance had opened Uncle Julian\u2019s room and cleaned it. She brought out the sheets from Uncle Julian\u2019s bed, and the blankets, and washed them in the kitchen sink and set them outside to dry in the sunlight. \u201cWhat are you going to do with Uncle Julian\u2019s papers?\u201d I asked her, and she rested her hands against the edge of the sink, hesitating. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll keep them all in the box,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll put the box down in the cellar.\u201d \u201cAnd preserve it?\u201d\u201cAnd preserve it. He would like to think that his papers were treated respectfully. And I would not want Uncle Julian to suspect that his papers were not preserved.\u201d \u201cI had better go and see that the front door is locked.\u201d The children were often outside on our front lawn, playing their still games and not looking at our house, moving awkwardly in little dashing runs, and slapping one another without cause. Whenever I checked to make sure that the front door was locked I looked out to see if the children were there. Very often I saw people walking on our path now, using it to go from one place to another, and putting their feet down where once only my feet had gone; I thought they used the path without wanting to, as though each of them had to travel it once to show that it could be done, but I thought that only a few, the defiant hating ones, came by more than once. I dreamed away the long afternoon while Constance cleaned Uncle Julian\u2019s room; I sat on the doorsill with Jonas asleep beside me, and looked out on the quiet safe garden. \u201cLook, Merricat,\u201d Constance said, coming to me with an armful of clothes, \u201clook, Uncle Julian had two suits, and a topcoat and a hat.\u201d \u201cHe walked upright once; he told us so himself.\u201d \u201cI can just barely remember him, years ago, going off one day to buy a suit, and I suppose it was one of these suits he bought; they are neither of them much worn.\u201d \u201cWhat would he have been wearing on the last day with them? What tie did he have on at dinner? He would surely like to have it remembered.\u201d She looked at me for a minute, not smiling. \u201cIt would hardly have been one of these; when I came to get him afterwards, at the hospital, he was wearing pajamas and a robe.\u201d \u201cPerhaps he should have one of these suits now.\u201d \u201cHe was probably buried in an old suit of Jim Clarke\u2019s.\u201d Constance started for the cellar, and then stopped. \u201cMerricat?\u201d \u201cYes, Constance?\u201d \u201cDo you realize that these things of Uncle Julian\u2019s are the only clothes left in our house? All of mine burned, and all of yours.\u201d \u201cAnd everything of theirs in the attic.\u201d \u201cI have only this pink dress I have on.\u201d I looked down. \u201cAnd I am wearing brown.\u201d \u201cAnd yours needs washing, and mending; how can you tear your clothes so, my Merricat?\u201d\u201cI shall weave a suit of leaves. At once. With acorns for buttons.\u201d \u201cMerricat, be serious. We will have to wear Uncle Julian\u2019s clothes.\u201d \u201cI am not allowed to touch Uncle Julian\u2019s things. I shall have a lining of moss, for cold winter days, and a hat made of bird feathers.\u201d \u201cThat may be all very well for the moon, Miss Foolishness. On the moon you may wear a suit of fur like Jonas, for all of me. But right here in our house you are going to be clothed in one of your Uncle Julian\u2019s old shirts, and perhaps his trousers too.\u201d \u201cOr Uncle Julian\u2019s bathrobe and pajamas, I suppose. No; I am not allowed to touch Uncle Julian\u2019s things; I will wear leaves.\u201d \u201cBut you are allowed. I tell you that you are allowed.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019ll probably see me wearing them.\u201d Then she stopped, and laughed, and looked at me, and laughed again. \u201cConstance?\u201d I said. She put Uncle Julian\u2019s clothes over the back of a chair, and, still laughing, went into the pantry and opened one of the drawers. I remembered what she was after and I laughed too. Then she came back and put an armload of tablecloths down beside me. \u201cThese will do you very nicely, elegant Merricat. Look; how will you feel in this, with a border of yellow flowers? Or this handsome red and white check? The damask, I am afraid, is too stiff for comfort, and besides it has been darned.\u201d I stood up and held the red and white checked tablecloth against me. \u201cYou can cut a hole for my head,\u201d I said; I was pleased. \u201cI have no sewing things. You will simply have to tie it around your waist with a cord or let it hang like a toga.\u201d \u201cI will use the damask for a cloak; who else wears a damask cloak?\u201d \u201cMerricat, oh, Merricat.\u201d Constance dropped the tablecloth she was holding and put her arms around me. \u201cWhat have I done to my baby Merricat?\u201d she said. \u201cNo house. No food. And dressed in a tablecloth; what have I done ?\u201d \u201cConstance,\u201d I said, \u201cI love you, Constance.\u201d \u201cDressed in a tablecloth like a rag doll.\u201d \u201cConstance. We are going to be very happy, Constance.\u201d \u201cOh, Merricat,\u201d she said, holding me. \u201cListen to me, Constance. We are going to be very happy.\u201d I dressed at once, not wanting to give Constance more time to think. I chose the red and white check, and when Constance had cut a hole formy head I took my gold cord with the tassel that Constance had cut from the drawing-room drapes and tied it around me for a belt and looked, I thought, very fine. Constance was sad at first, and turned away sadly when she saw me, and scrubbed furiously at the sink to get my brown dress clean, but I liked my robe, and danced in it, and before long she smiled again and then laughed at me. \u201cRobinson Crusoe dressed in the skins of animals,\u201d I told her. \u201cHe had no gay cloths with a gold belt.\u201d \u201cI must say you never looked so bright before.\u201d \u201cYou will be wearing the skins of Uncle Julian; I prefer my tablecloth.\u201d \u201cI believe the one you are wearing now was used for summer breakfasts on the lawn many years ago. Red and white check would never be used in the dining room, of course.\u201d \u201cSome days I shall be a summer breakfast on the lawn, and some days I shall be a formal dinner by candlelight, and some days I shall be \u2014\u201d \u201cA very dirty Merricat. You have a fine gown, but your face is dirty. We have lost almost everything, young lady, but at least we still have clean water and a comb.\u201d One thing was most lucky about Uncle Julian\u2019s room: I persuaded Constance to bring out his chair and wheel it through the garden to reinforce my barricade. It looked strange to see Constance wheeling the empty chair, and for a minute I tried to see Uncle Julian again, riding with his hands in his lap, but all that remained of Uncle Julian\u2019s presence were the worn spots on the chair, and a handkerchief tucked under the cushion. The chair would be powerful in my barricade, however, staring out always at intruders with a blank menace of dead Uncle Julian. I was troubled to think that Uncle Julian might vanish altogether, with his papers in a box and his chair on the barricade and his toothbrush thrown away and even the smell of Uncle Julian gone from his room, but when the ground was soft Constance planted a yellow rosebush at Uncle Julian\u2019s spot on the lawn, and one night I went down to the creek and buried Uncle Julian\u2019s initialled gold pencil by the water, so the creek would always speak his name. Jonas took to going into Uncle Julian\u2019s room, where he had never gone before, but I did not go inside. Helen Clarke came to our door twice more, knocking and calling and begging us to answer, but we sat quietly, and when she found that shecould not come around the house because of my barricade she told us from the front door that she would not come back, and she did not. One evening, perhaps the evening of the day Constance planted Uncle Julian\u2019s rosebush, we heard a very soft knock at our front door while we sat at the table eating dinner. It was far too soft a knock for Helen Clarke, and I left the table and hurried silently down the hall to be sure that the front door was locked, and Constance followed me, curious. We pressed silently against the door and listened. \u201cMiss Blackwood?\u201d someone said outside, in a low voice; I wondered if he suspected we were so close to him. \u201cMiss Constance? Miss Mary Katherine?\u201d It was not quite dark outside, but inside where we stood we could only see one another dimly, two white faces against the door. \u201cMiss Constance?\u201d he said again. \u201cListen.\u201d I thought that he was moving his head from side to side to make sure that he was not seen. \u201cListen,\u201d he said, \u201cI got a chicken here.\u201d He tapped softly on the door. \u201cI hope you can hear me,\u201d he said. \u201cI got a chicken here. My wife fixed it, roasted it nice, and there\u2019s some cookies and a pie. I hope you can hear me.\u201d I could see that Constance\u2019s eyes were wide with wonder. I stared at her and she stared at me. \u201cI sure hope you can hear me, Miss Blackwood. I broke one of your chairs and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He tapped against the door again, very softly. \u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll just set this basket down on your step here. I hope you heard me. Goodbye.\u201d We listened to quiet footsteps going away, and after a minute Constance said, \u201cWhat shall we do? Shall we open the door?\u201d \u201cLater,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll come when it\u2019s really dark.\u201d \u201cI wonder what kind of pie it is. Do you think it\u2019s as good as my pies?\u201d We finished our dinner and waited until I was sure that no one could possibly see the front door opening, and then we went down the hall and I unlocked the door and looked outside. The basket sat on the doorstep, covered with a napkin. I brought it inside and locked the door while Constance took the basket from me and carried it to the kitchen. \u201cBlueberry,\u201d she said when I came. \u201cQuite good, too; it\u2019s still warm.\u201d She took out the chicken, wrapped in a napkin, and the little package of cookies, touching each lovingly and with gentleness. \u201cEverything\u2019s still warm,\u201d she said. \u201cShe must have baked them right after dinner, sohe could bring them right over. I wonder if she made two pies, one for the house. She wrapped everything while it was still warm and told him to bring them over. These cookies are not crisp enough.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll take the basket back and leave it on the porch, so he\u2019ll know we found it.\u201d \u201cNo, no.\u201d Constance caught me by the arm. \u201cNot until I\u2019ve washed the napkins; what would she think of me?\u201d Sometimes they brought bacon, home-cured, or fruit, or their own preserves, which were never as good as the preserves Constance made. Mostly they brought roasted chicken; sometimes a cake or a pie, frequently cookies, sometimes a potato salad or coleslaw. Once they brought a pot of beef stew, which Constance took apart and put back together again according to her own rules for beef stew, and sometimes there were pots of baked beans or macaroni. \u201cWe are the biggest church supper they ever had,\u201d Constance said once, looking at a loaf of homemade bread I had just brought inside. These things were always left on the front doorstep, always silently and in the evenings. We thought that the men came home from work and the women had the baskets ready for them to carry over; perhaps they came in darkness not to be recognized, as though each of them wanted to hide from the others, and bringing us food was somehow a shameful thing to do in public. There were many women cooking, Constance said. \u201cHere is one,\u201d she explained to me once, tasting a bean, \u201cwho uses ketchup, and too much of it; and the last one used more molasses.\u201d Once or twice there was a note in the basket: \u201cThis is for the dishes,\u201d or \u201cWe apologize about the curtains,\u201d or \u201cSorry for your harp.\u201d We always set the baskets back where we had found them, and never opened the front door until it was completely dark and we were sure that no one was near. I always checked carefully afterwards to make certain that the front door was locked. I discovered that I was no longer allowed to go to the creek; Uncle Julian was there, and it was much too far from Constance. I never went farther away than the edge of the woods, and Constance went only as far as the vegetable garden. I was not allowed to bury anything more, nor was I allowed to touch stone. Every day I looked over the boards across the kitchen windows and when I found small cracks I nailed on more boards. Every morning I checked at once to make sure the front door was locked, and every morning Constance washed the kitchen. We spent a good deal of time at the front door, particularly during theafternoons, when most people came by; we sat, one on either side of the front door, looking out through the narrow glass panels which I had covered almost entirely with cardboard so that we had each only a small peephole and no one could possibly see inside. We watched the children playing, and the people walking past, and we heard their voices and they were all strangers, with their wide staring eyes and their evil open mouths. One day a group came by bicycle; there were two women and a man, and two children. They parked their bicycles in our driveway and lay down on our front lawn, pulling at the grass and talking while they rested. The children ran up and down our driveway and over and around the trees and bushes. This was the day that we learned that the vines were growing over the burned roof of our house, because one of the women glanced sideways at the house and said that the vines almost hid the marks of burning. They rarely turned squarely to look at our house face to face, but looked from the corners of their eyes or from over a shoulder or through their fingers. \u201cIt used to be a lovely old house, I hear,\u201d said the woman sitting on our grass. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that it was quite a local landmark at one time.\u201d \u201cNow it looks like a tomb,\u201d the other woman said. \u201cShh,\u201d the first woman said, and gestured toward the house with her head. \u201cI heard,\u201d she said loudly, \u201cthat they had a staircase which was very fine. Carved in Italy, I heard.\u201d \u201cThey can\u2019t hear you,\u201d the other woman said, amused. \u201cAnd who cares if they do, anyway?\u201d \u201cShhh.\u201d \u201cNo one knows for sure if there\u2019s anyone inside or not. The local people tell some tall tales.\u201d \u201cShh. Tommy,\u201d she called to one of the children, \u201cdon\u2019t you go near those steps.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d said the child, backing away. \u201cBecause the ladies live in there, and they don\u2019t like it.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d said the child, pausing at the foot of the steps and giving a quick look backward at our front door. \u201cThe ladies don\u2019t like little boys,\u201d the second woman said; she was one of the bad ones; I could see her mouth from the side and it was the mouth of a snake. \u201cWhat would they do to me?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019d hold you down and make you eat candy full of poison; I heard that dozens of bad little boys have gone too near that house and never been seen again. They catch little boys and they\u2014\u201d\u201cShh. Honestly, Ethel.\u201d \u201cDo they like little girls?\u201d The other child drew near. \u201cThey hate little boys and little girls. The difference is, they eat the little girls.\u201d \u201cEthel, stop. You\u2019re terrifying the children. It isn\u2019t true, darlings; she\u2019s only teasing you.\u201d \u201cThey never come out except at night,\u201d the bad woman said, looking evilly at the children, \u201cand then when it\u2019s dark they go hunting little children.\u201d \u201cJust the same,\u201d the man said suddenly, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the kids going too near that house.\u201d Charles Blackwood came back only once. He came in a car with another man late one afternoon when we had been watching for a long time. All the strangers had gone, and Constance had just stirred and said, \u201cTime to put on the potatoes,\u201d when the car turned into the driveway and she settled back to watch again. Charles and the other man got out of the car in front of the house and walked directly to the foot of the steps, looking up, although they could not see us inside. I remembered the first time Charles had come and stood looking up at our house in just the same manner, but this time he would never get in. I reached up and touched the lock on the front door to make sure it was fastened, and on the other side of the doorway Constance turned and nodded to me; she knew, too, that Charles would never get in again. \u201cSee?\u201d Charles said, outside, at the foot of our steps. \u201cThere\u2019s the house, just like I said. It doesn\u2019t look as bad as it did, now the vines have grown so. But the roof\u2019s been burned away, and the place was gutted inside.\u201d \u201cAre the ladies in there?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d Charles laughed, and I remembered his laughter and his big staring white face and from inside the door I wished him dead. \u201cThey\u2019re in there all right,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so is a whole damn fortune.\u201d \u201cYou know that?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got money in there\u2019s never even been counted. They\u2019ve got it buried all over, and a safe full, and God knows where else they\u2019ve hidden it. They never come out, just hide away inside with all that money.\u201d \u201cLook,\u201d the other man said, \u201cthey know you, don\u2019t they?\u201d \u201cSure. I\u2019m their cousin. I came here on a visit once.\u201d\u201cYou think there\u2019s any chance you might get one of them to talk to you? Maybe come to the window or something, so I could get a picture?\u201d Charles thought. He looked at the house and at the other man, and thought. \u201cIf you sell this, to the magazine or somewhere, do I get half?\u201d \u201cSure, it\u2019s a promise.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll try it,\u201d Charles said. \u201cYou get back behind the car, out of sight. They certainly won\u2019t come out if they see a stranger.\u201d The other man went back to the car and took out a camera and settled himself on the other side of the car where we could not see him. \u201cOkay,\u201d he called, and Charles started up the steps to our front door. \u201cConnie?\u201d he called. \u201cHey, Connie? It\u2019s Charles; I\u2019m back.\u201d I looked at Constance and thought she had never seen Charles so truly before. \u201cConnie?\u201d She knew now that Charles was a ghost and a demon, one of the strangers. \u201cLet\u2019s forget all that happened,\u201d Charles said. He came close to the door and spoke pleasantly, with a little pleading tone. \u201cLet\u2019s be friends again.\u201d I could see his feet. One of them was tapping and tapping on the floor of our porch. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got against me,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve been waiting and waiting for you to let me know I could come back again. If I did anything to offend you, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d I wished Charles could see inside, could see us sitting on the floor on either side of the front door, listening to him and looking at his feet, while he talked beggingly to the door three feet above our heads. \u201cOpen the door,\u201d he said very softly. \u201cConnie, will you open the door for me, for Cousin Charles?\u201d Constance looked up to where his face must be and smiled unpleasantly. I thought it must be a smile she had been saving for Charles if he ever came back again. \u201cI went to see old Julian\u2019s grave this morning,\u201d Charles said. \u201cI came back to visit old Julian\u2019s grave and to see you once more.\u201d He waited a minute and then said with a little break in his voice, \u201cI put a couple of flowers\u2014 you know\u2014on the old fellow\u2019s grave; he was a fine old guy, and he was always pretty good to me.\u201d Beyond Charles\u2019 feet I saw the other man coming out from behind the car with his camera. \u201cLook,\u201d he called, \u201cyou\u2019re wasting your breath. And I haven\u2019t got all day.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d Charles had turned away from the door, but his voice still had the little break in it. \u201cI\u2019ve got to see her once more. I was the cause of it all.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWhy do you suppose two old maids shut themselves up in a house like this? God knows,\u201d Charles said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it to turn out this way.\u201d I thought Constance was going to speak then, or at least laugh out loud, and I reached across and touched her arm, warning her to be quiet, but she did not turn her head to me. \u201cIf I could just talk to her,\u201d Charles said. \u201cYou can get some pictures of the house, anyway, with me standing here. Or knocking at the door; I could be knocking frantically at the door.\u201d \u201cYou could be stretched across the doorsill dying of a broken heart, for all of me,\u201d the other man said. He went to the car and put his camera inside. \u201cWaste of time.\u201d \u201cAnd all that money. Connie,\u201d Charles called loudly, \u201cwill you for heaven\u2019s sake open that door?\u201d \u201cYou know,\u201d the other man said from the car, \u201cI\u2019ll just bet you\u2019re never going to see those silver dollars again.\u201d \u201cConnie,\u201d Charles said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing to me; I never deserved to be treated like this. Please, Connie.\u201d \u201cYou want to walk back to town?\u201d the other man said. He closed the car door. Charles turned away from the door and then turned back. \u201cAll right, Connie,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is it. If you let me go this time, you\u2019ll never see me again. I mean it, Connie.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d the other man said from the car. \u201cI mean it, Connie, I really do.\u201d Charles started down the steps, talking over his shoulder. \u201cTake a last look,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going. One word could make me stay.\u201d I did not think he was going to go in time. I honestly did not know whether Constance was going to be able to contain herself until he got down the steps and safely into the car. \u201cGoodbye, Connie,\u201d he said from the foot of the steps and then turned away and went slowly toward the car. He looked for a minute as though he might wipe his eyes or blow his nose, but the other man said, \u201cHurry up, \u201d and Charles looked back once more, raised his hand sadly, and got into the car. Then Constance laughed, and I laughed, and for a minute I saw Charles in the car turn his head quickly, as though he had heard uslaughing, but the car started, and drove off down the driveway, and we held each other in the dark hall and laughed, with the tears running down our cheeks and echoes of our laughter going up the ruined stairway to the sky. \u201cI am so happy,\u201d Constance said at last, gasping. \u201cMerricat, I am so happy.\u201d \u201cI told you that you would like it on the moon.\u201d The Carringtons stopped their car in front of our house one Sunday after church and sat quietly in the car looking at our house, as though supposing that we would come out if there was anything the Carringtons could do for us. Sometimes I thought of the drawing room and the dining room, forever closed away, with our mother\u2019s lovely broken things lying scattered, and the dust sifting gently down to cover them; we had new landmarks in the house, just as we had a new pattern for our days. The crooked, broken-off fragment which was all that was left of our lovely stairway was something we passed every day and came to know as intimately as we had once known the stairs themselves. The boards across the kitchen windows were ours, and part of our house, and we loved them. We were very happy, although Constance was always in terror lest one of our two cups should break, and one of us have to use a cup without a handle. We had our well- known and familiar places: our chairs at the table, and our beds, and our places beside the front door. Constance washed the red and white tablecloth and the shirts of Uncle Julian\u2019s which she wore, and while they were hanging in the garden to dry I wore a tablecloth with a yellow border, which looked very handsome with my gold belt. Our mother\u2019s old brown shoes were safely put away in my corner of the kitchen, since in the warm summer days I went barefoot like Jonas. Constance disliked picking many flowers, but there was always a bowl on the kitchen table with roses or daisies, although of course she never picked a rose from Uncle Julian\u2019s rosebush. I sometimes thought of my six blue marbles, but I was not allowed to go to the long field now, and I thought that perhaps my six blue marbles had been buried to protect a house which no longer existed and had no connection with the house where we lived now, and where we were very happy. My new magical safeguards were the lock on the front door, and the boards over the windows, and the barricades along the sides of the house. In the evenings sometimes we saw movement in the darkness on the lawn, and heard whispers.\u201cDon\u2019t; the ladies might be watching.\u201d \u201cYou think they can see in the dark?\u201d \u201cI heard they see everything that goes on.\u201d Then there might be laughter, drifting away into the warm darkness. \u201cThey will soon be calling this Lover\u2019s Lane,\u201d Constance said. \u201cAfter Charles, no doubt.\u201d \u201cThe least Charles could have done,\u201d Constance said, considering seriously, \u201cwas shoot himself through the head in the driveway.\u201d We learned, from listening, that all the strangers could see from outside, when they looked at all, was a great ruined structure overgrown with vines, barely recognizable as a house. It was the point halfway between the village and the highway, the middle spot on the path, and no one ever saw our eyes looking out through the vines. \u201cYou can\u2019t go on those steps,\u201d the children warned each other; \u201cif you do, the ladies will get you.\u201d Once a boy, dared by the others, stood at the foot of the steps facing the house, and shivered and almost cried and almost ran away, and then called out shakily, \u201cMerricat, said Constance, would you like a cup of tea?\u201d and then fled, followed by all the others. That night we found on the doorsill a basket of fresh eggs and a note reading, \u201cHe didn\u2019t mean it, please.\u201d \u201cPoor child,\u201d Constance said, putting the eggs into a bowl to go into the cooler. \u201cHe\u2019s probably hiding under the bed right now.\u201d \u201cPerhaps he had a good whipping to teach him manners.\u201d \u201cWe will have an omelette for breakfast.\u201d \u201cI wonder if I could eat a child if I had the chance.\u201d \u201cI doubt if I could cook one,\u201d said Constance. \u201cPoor strangers,\u201d I said. \u201cThey have so much to be afraid of.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d Constance said, \u201cI am afraid of spiders.\u201d \u201cJonas and I will see to it that no spider ever comes near you. Oh, Constance,\u201d I said, \u201cwe are so happy.\u201d Table of Contents WE HAVE ALWAYS LIVED IN THE CASTLE Title Page Copyright Page Introduction Dedication Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Chapter 7 Chapter 8 Chapter 9 Chapter 10",
