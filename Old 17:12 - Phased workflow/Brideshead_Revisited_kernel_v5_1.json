      "chapter_text": "Collins had exposed the fallacy of modern aesthetics to me: \u201c\u2026 the whole argument from Significant Form stands or falls by volume . If you allow C\u00e9zanne to represent a third dimension on his two-dimensional canvas, then you must allow Landseer his gleam of loyalty in the spaniel\u2019s eye\u201d\u2026 but it was not until Sebastian, idly turning the page of Clive Bell\u2019s Art, read: \u201c \u2018Does anyone feel the same kind of emotion for a butterfly or a flower that he feels for a cathedral or a picture?\u2019 Yes. I do,\u201d that my eyes were opened. I knew Sebastian by sight long before I met him. That was unavoidable for, from his first week, he was the most conspicuous man of his year by reason of his beauty, which was arresting, and his eccentricities of behavior, which seemed to know no bounds. My first sight of him was in the door of Germer\u2019s, and, on that occasion, I was struck less by his looks than by the fact that he was carrying a large teddy-bear. \u201cThat,\u201d said the barber, as I took his chair, \u201cwas Lord Sebastian Flyte. A most amusing young gentleman.\u201d \u201cApparently,\u201d I said coldly. \u201cThe Marquis of Marchmain\u2019s second boy. His brother, the Earl of Brideshead, went down last term. Now he was very different, a very quiet gentleman, quite like an old man. What do you suppose Lord Sebastian wanted? A hair brush for his teddy-bear; it had to have very stiff bristles, not , Lord Sebastian said, to brush him with, but to threaten him with a spanking when he was sulky. He bought a very nice one with an ivory back and he\u2019s having \u2018Aloysius\u2019 engraved on it\u2014that\u2019s the bear\u2019s name.\u201d The man, who, in his time, had had ample chance to tire of undergraduate fantasy, was plainly captivated. I, however, remained censorious, and subsequent glimpses of him, driving in a hansom cab and dining at the George in false whiskers, did not soften me, although Collins, who was reading Freud, had a number of technical terms to cover everything.Nor, when at last we met, were the circumstances propitious. It was shortly before midnight in early March; I had been entertaining the college intellectuals to mulled claret; the fire was roaring, the air of my room heavy with smoke and spice, and my mind weary with metaphysics. I threw open my windows and from the quad outside came the not uncommon sounds of bibulous laughter and unsteady steps. A voice said: \u201cHold up\u201d; another, \u201cCome on\u201d; another, \u201cPlenty of time\u2026 House\u2026 till Tom stops ringing\u201d; and another, clearer than the rest, \u201cD\u2019you know I feel most unaccountably unwell. I must leave you a minute,\u201d and there appeared at my window the face I knew to be Sebastian\u2019s, but not, as I had formerly seen it, alive and alight with gaiety; he looked at me for a moment with unfocused eyes and then, leaning forward well into the room, he was sick. It was not unusual for dinner parties to end in that way; there was in fact a recognized tariff for the scout on such occasions; we were all learning, by trial and error, to carry our wine. There was also a kind of insane and endearing orderliness about Sebastian\u2019s choice, in his extremity, of an open window. But, when all is said, it remained an unpropitious meeting. His friends bore him to the gate and, in a few minutes, his host, an amiable Etonian of my year, returned to apologize. He, too, was tipsy and his explanations were repetitive and, towards the end, tearful. \u201cThe wines were too various,\u201d he said: \u201cit was neither the quality nor the quantity that was at fault. It was the mixture. Grasp that and you have the root of the matter. To understand all is to forgive all.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I said, but it was with a sense of grievance that I faced Lunt\u2019s reproaches next morning. \u201cA couple of jugs of mulled claret between the five of you,\u201d Lunt said, \u201cand this had to happen. Couldn\u2019t even get to the window. Those that can\u2019t keep it down are better without it.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t one of my party. It was someone from out of college.\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s just as nasty clearing it up, whoever it was.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s five shillings on the sideboard.\u201d \u201cSo I saw and thank you, but I\u2019d rather not have the money and not have the mess, any morning.\u201d I took my gown and left him to his task. I still frequented the lecture-room in those days, and it was after eleven when I returned to college. I found my room full of flowers; what looked like, and, in fact, was, the entire day\u2019s stock of a market-stall stood in every conceivable vessel in every part of the room.Lunt was secreting the last of them in brown paper preparatory to taking them home. \u201cLunt, what is all this?\u201d \u201cThe gentleman from last night, sir, he left a note for you.\u201d The note was written in cont\u00e9 crayon on a whole sheet of my choice Whatman H.P. drawing paper: I am very contrite. Aloysius won\u2019t speak to me until he sees I am forgiven, so please come to luncheon today. Sebastian Flyte. It was typical of him, I reflected, to assume I knew where he lived; but, then, I did know. \u201cA most amusing gentleman, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s quite a pleasure to clean up after him. I take it you\u2019re lunching out, sir. I told Mr. Collins and Mr. Partridge so \u2014they wanted to have their commons in here with you.\u201d \u201cYes, Lunt, lunching out.\u201d That luncheon party\u2014for party it proved to be\u2014was the beginning of a new epoch in my life. I went there uncertainly, for it was foreign ground and there was a tiny, priggish, warning voice in my ear which in the tones of Collins told me it was seemly to hold back. But I was in search of love in those days, and I went full of curiosity and the faint, unrecognized apprehension that here, at last, I should find that low door in the wall, which others, I knew, had found before me, which opened on an enclosed and enchanted garden, which was somewhere, not overlooked by any window, in the heart of that gray city. Sebastian lived at Christ Church, high in Meadow Buildings. He was alone when I came, peeling a plover\u2019s egg taken from the large nest of moss in the center of his table. \u201cI\u2019ve just counted them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were five each and two over, so I\u2019m having the two. I\u2019m unaccountably hungry today. I put myself unreservedly in the hands of Dolbear and Goodall, and feel so drugged that I\u2019ve begun to believe that the whole of yesterday evening was a dream. Please don\u2019t wake me up.\u201d He was entrancing, with that epicene beauty which in extreme youth sings aloud for love and withers at the first cold wind. His room was filled with a strange jumble of objects\u2014a harmonium in a gothic case, an elephant\u2019s-foot waste-paper basket, a dome of wax fruit, two disproportionately large S\u00e8vres vases, framed drawings by Daumier\u2014made all the more incongruous by the austere college furniture and the large luncheon table. His chimneypiece was covered in cards of invitation from London hostesses. \u201cThat beast Hobson has put Aloysius next door,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s as well, as there wouldn\u2019t have been any plovers\u2019 eggs for him. D\u2019you know,Hobson hates Aloysius. I wish I had a scout like yours. He was sweet to me this morning where some people might have been quite strict.\u201d The party assembled. There were three Etonian freshmen, mild, elegant, detached young men who had all been to a dance in London the night before, and spoke of it as though it had been the funeral of a near but unloved kinsman. Each as he came into the room made first for the plovers\u2019 eggs, then noticed Sebastian and then myself with a polite lack of curiosity which seemed to say: \u201cWe should not dream of being so offensive as to suggest that you never met us before.\u201d \u201cThe first this year,\u201d they said. \u201cWhere do you get them?\u201d \u201cMummy sends them from Brideshead. They always lay early for her.\u201d When the eggs were gone and we were eating the lobster Newburg, the last guest arrived. \u201cMy dear,\u201d he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t get away before. I was lunching with my p- p-preposterous tutor. He thought it very odd my leaving when I did. I told him I had to change for F-f-footer .\u201d He was tall, slim, rather swarthy, with large saucy eyes. The rest of us wore rough tweeds and brogues. He had on a smooth chocolate-brown suit with loud white stripes, suede shoes, a large bow-tie and he drew off yellow, wash-leather gloves as he came into the room; part Gallic, part Yankee, part, perhaps, Jew; wholly exotic. This, I did not need telling, was Anthony Blanche, the \u201caesthete\u201d par excellence , a byword of iniquity from Cherwell Edge to Somerville. He had been pointed out to me often in the streets, as he pranced along with his high peacock tread; I had heard his voice in the George challenging the conventions; and now meeting him, under the spell of Sebastian, I found myself enjoying him voraciously. After luncheon he stood on the balcony with a megaphone which had appeared surprisingly among the bric-\u00e0-brac of Sebastian\u2019s room, and in languishing tones recited passages from The Waste Land to the sweatered and muffled throng that was on its way to the river. \u201cI, Tiresias, have foresuffered all,\u201d he sobbed to them from the Venetian arches; \u201cEnacted on this same d-divan or b-bed, I who have sat by Thebes below the wall And walked among the l-l-lowest of the dead \u2026. \u201d And then, stepping lightly into the room, \u201cHow I have surprised them! All b-boatmen are Grace Darlings to me.\u201dWe sat on sipping Cointreau while the mildest and most detached of the Etonians sang: \u201cHome they brought her warrior dead\u201d to his own accompaniment on the harmonium. It was four o\u2019clock before we broke up. Anthony Blanche was the first to go. He took formal and complimentary leave of each of us in turn. To Sebastian he said: \u201cMy dear, I should like to stick you full of barbed arrows like a p-p-pin-cushion,\u201d and to me: \u201cI think it\u2019s perfectly brilliant of Sebastian to have discovered you. Where do you lurk? I shall come down your burrow and ch-chivvy you out like an old st-t-toat.\u201d The others left soon after him. I rose to go with them, but Sebastian said: \u201cHave some more Cointreau,\u201d so I stayed and later he said, \u201cI must go to the Botanical Gardens.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cTo see the ivy.\u201d It seemed a good enough reason and I went with him. He took my arm as we walked under the walls of Merton. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to the Botanical Gardens,\u201d I said. \u201cOh, Charles, what a lot you have to learn! There\u2019s a beautiful arch there and more different kinds of ivy than I knew existed. I don\u2019t know where I should be without the Botanical Gardens.\u201d When at length I returned to my rooms and found them exactly as I had left them that morning, I detected a jejune air that had not irked me before. What was wrong? Nothing except the golden daffodils seemed to be real. Was it the screen? I turned it face to the wall. That was better. It was the end of the screen. Lunt never liked it, and after a few days he took it away, to an obscure refuge he had under the stairs, full of mops and buckets. That day was the beginning of my friendship with Sebastian, and thus it came about, that morning in June, that I was lying beside him in the shade of the high elms watching the smoke from his lips drift up into the branches. Presently we drove on and in another hour were hungry. We stopped at an inn, which was half farm also, and ate eggs and bacon, pickled walnuts and cheese, and drank our beer in a sunless parlor where an old clock ticked in the shadows and a cat slept by the empty grate. We drove on and in the early afternoon came to our destination: wrought- iron gates and twin, classical lodges on a village green, an avenue, more gates, open park-land, a turn in the drive; and suddenly a new and secretlandscape opened before us. We were at the head of a valley and below us, half a mile distant, gray and gold amid a screen of boskage, shone the dome and columns of an old house. \u201cWell?\u201d said Sebastian, stopping the car. Beyond the dome lay receding steps of water and round it, guarding and hiding it, stood the soft hills. \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cWhat a place to live in!\u201d I said. \u201cYou must see the garden front and the fountain.\u201d He leaned forward and put the car into gear. \u201cIt\u2019s where my family live\u201d; and even then, rapt in the vision, I felt, momentarily, an ominous chill at the words he used\u2014not, \u201cthat is my house,\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s where my family live.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he continued, \u201cthey\u2019re all away. You won\u2019t have to meet them.\u201d \u201cBut I should like to.\u201d \u201cWell, you can\u2019t. They\u2019re in London.\u201d We drove round the front into a side court\u2014\u201cEverything\u2019s shut up. We\u2019d better go in this way\u201d\u2014and entered through the fortress-like, stone-flagged, stone-vaulted passages of the servants\u2019 quarters\u2014\u201cI want you to meet Nanny Hawkins. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve come for\u201d\u2014and climbed uncarpeted, scrubbed elm stairs, followed more passages of wide boards covered in the center by a thin strip of drugget, through passages covered by linoleum, passing the wells of many minor staircases and many rows of crimson and gold fire buckets, up a final staircase, gated at the head. The dome was false, designed to be seen from below like the cupolas of Chambord. Its drum was merely an additional storey full of segmental rooms. Here were the nurseries. Sebastian\u2019s nanny was seated at the open window; the fountain lay before her, the lakes, the temple, and, far away on the last spur, a glittering obelisk; her hands lay open in her lap and, loosely between them, a rosary; she was fast asleep. Long hours of work in her youth, authority in middle life, repose and security in her age, had set their stamp on her lined and serene face. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, waking; \u201cthis is a surprise.\u201d Sebastian kissed her. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d she said, looking at me. \u201cI don\u2019t think I know him.\u201d Sebastian introduced us. \u201cYou\u2019ve come just the right time. Julia\u2019s here for the day. Such a time they\u2019re all having. It\u2019s dull without them. Just Mrs. Chandler and two of the girls and old Bert. And then they\u2019re all going on holidays and the boiler\u2019s being done out in August and you going to see his Lordship in Italy, and the rest on visits, it\u2019ll be October before we\u2019re settled down again. Still, I suppose Julia must have her enjoyment the same as other young ladies, though whatthey always want to go to London for in the best of the summer and the gardens all out, I never have understood. Father Phipps was here on Thursday and I said exactly the same to him,\u201d she added as though she had thus acquired sacerdotal authority for her opinion. \u201cD\u2019you say Julia\u2019s here?\u201d \u201cYes, dear, you must have just missed her. It\u2019s the Conservative Women. Her Ladyship was to have done them, but she\u2019s poorly. Julia won\u2019t be long; she\u2019s leaving immediately after her speech, before the tea.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid we may miss her again.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t do that, dear, it\u2019ll be such a surprise to her seeing you, though she ought to wait for the tea, I told her, it\u2019s what the Conservative Women come for. Now what\u2019s the news? Are you studying hard at your books?\u201d \u201cNot very, I\u2019m afraid, nanny.\u201d \u201cAh, cricketing all day long I expect, like your brother. He found time to study, too, though. He\u2019s not been here since Christmas, but he\u2019ll be here for the Agricultural, I expect. Did you see this piece about Julia in the paper? She brought it down for me. Not that it\u2019s nearly good enough of her, but what it says is very nice. \u2018The lovely daughter whom Lady Marchmain is bringing out this season\u2026 witty as well as ornamental\u2026 the most popular debutante,\u2019 well that\u2019s no more than the truth, though it was a shame to cut her hair; such a lovely head of hair she had, just like her Ladyship\u2019s. I said to Father Phipps it\u2019s not natural. He said: \u2018Nuns do it,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Well, surely, Father, you aren\u2019t going to make a nun out of Lady Julia? The very idea!\u2019 \u201d Sebastian and the old woman talked on. It was a charming room, oddly shaped to conform with the curve of the dome. The walls were papered in a pattern of ribbon and roses. There was a rocking horse in the corner and an oleograph of the Sacred Heart over the mantelpiece; the empty grate was hidden by a bunch of pampas grass and bulrushes; laid out on the top of the chest of drawers and carefully dusted, were the collection of small presents which had been brought home to her at various times by her children, carved shell and lava, stamped leather, painted wood, china, bog-oak, damascened silver, blue-john, alabaster, coral, the souvenirs of many holidays. Presently nanny said: \u201cRing the bell, dear, and we\u2019ll have some tea. I usually go down to Mrs. Chandler, but we\u2019ll have it up here today. My usual girl has gone to London with the others. The new one is just up from the village. She didn\u2019t know anything at first, but she\u2019s coming along nicely. Ring the bell.\u201d But Sebastian said we had to go. \u201cAnd miss Julia? She will be upset when she hears. It would have been such a surprise for her.\u201d\u201cPoor nanny,\u201d said Sebastian when we left the nursery. \u201cShe does have such a dull life. I\u2019ve a good mind to bring her to Oxford to live with me, only she\u2019d always be trying to send me to church. We must go quickly before my sister gets back.\u201d \u201cWhich are you ashamed of, her or me?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m ashamed of myself,\u201d said Sebastian gravely. \u201cI\u2019m not going to have you get mixed up with my family. They\u2019re so madly charming. All my life they\u2019ve been taking things away from me. If they once got hold of you with their charm, they\u2019d make you their friend not mine, and I won\u2019t let them.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly content. But am I not going to be allowed to see any more of the house?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all shut up. We came to see nanny. On Queen Alexandra\u2019s day it\u2019s all open for a shilling. Well, come and look if you want to\u2026.\u201d He led me through a baize door into a dark corridor; I could dimly see a gilt cornice and vaulted plaster above; then, opening a heavy, smooth- swinging, mahogany door, he led me into a darkened hall. Light streamed through the cracks in the shutters. Sebastian unbarred one, and folded it back; the mellow afternoon sun flooded in, over the bare floor, the vast, twin fireplaces of sculptured marble, the coved ceiling frescoed with classic deities and heroes, the gilt mirrors and scagliola pilasters, the islands of sheeted furniture. It was a glimpse only, such as might be had from the top of an omnibus into a lighted ballroom; then Sebastian quickly shut out the sun. \u201cYou see,\u201d he said; \u201cit\u2019s like this.\u201d His mood had changed since we had drunk our wine under the elm trees, since we had turned the corner of the drive and he had said: \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cYou see, there\u2019s nothing to see. A few pretty things I\u2019d like to show you one day\u2014not now. But there\u2019s the chapel. You must see that. It\u2019s a monument of art nouveau .\u201d The last architect to work at Brideshead had added a colonnade and flanking pavilions. One of these was the chapel. We entered it by the public porch (another door led direct to the house); Sebastian dipped his fingers in the water stoup, crossed himself, and genuflected; I copied him. \u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d he asked crossly. \u201cJust good manners.\u201d \u201cWell, you needn\u2019t on my account. You wanted to do sight-seeing; how about this?\u201d The whole interior had been gutted, elaborately refurnished and redecorated in the arts-and-crafts style of the last decade of the nineteenth century. Angels in printed cotton smocks, rambler-roses, flower-spangled meadows, frisking lambs, texts in Celtic script, saints in armor, covered thewalls in an intricate pattern of clear, bright colors. There was a triptych of pale oak, carved so as to give it the peculiar property of seeming to have been molded in Plasticine. The sanctuary lamp and all the metal furniture were of bronze, hand-beaten to the patina of a pock-marked skin; the altar steps had a carpet of grass-green, strewn with white and gold daisies. \u201cGolly,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was papa\u2019s wedding present to mama. Now, if you\u2019ve seen enough, we\u2019ll go.\u201d On the drive we passed a closed Rolls-Royce driven by a chauffeur; in the back was a vague, girlish figure who looked round at us through the window. \u201cJulia,\u201d said Sebastian. \u201cWe only just got away in time.\u201d We stopped to speak to a man with a bicycle\u2014\u201cThat was old Bat,\u201d said Sebastian\u2014and then were away, past the wrought-iron gates, past the lodges, and out on the road heading back to Oxford. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Sebastian after a time. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I wasn\u2019t very nice this afternoon. Brideshead often has that effect on me. But I had to take you to see nanny.\u201d Why? I wondered; but said nothing\u2014Sebastian\u2019s life was governed by a code of such imperatives. \u201cI must have pillar-box red pajamas,\u201d \u201cI have to stay in bed until the sun works round to the windows,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve absolutely got to drink champagne tonight!\u201d\u2014except, \u201cIt had quite the reverse effect on me.\u201d After a long pause he said petulantly, \u201cI don\u2019t keep asking you questions about your family.\u201d \u201cNeither do I about yours.\u201d \u201cBut you look inquisitive.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019re so mysterious about them.\u201d \u201cI hoped I was mysterious about everything.\u201d \u201cPerhaps I am rather curious about people\u2019s families\u2014you see, it\u2019s not a thing I know about. There is only my father and myself. An aunt kept an eye on me for a time but my father drove her abroad. My mother was killed in the war.\u201d \u201cOh\u2026 how very unusual.\u201d \u201cShe went to Serbia with the Red Cross. My father has been rather odd in the head ever since. He just lives alone in London with no friends and footles about collecting things.\u201d Sebastian said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve been saved. There are lots of us. Look them up in Debrett.\u201d His mood was lightening now. The further we drove from Brideshead, the more he seemed to cast off his uneasiness\u2014the almost furtive restlessness and irritability that had possessed him. The sun was behind us as we drove, so thatwe seemed to be in pursuit of our own shadows. \u201cIt\u2019s half past five. We\u2019ll get to Godstow in time for dinner, drink at the Trout, leave Hardcastle\u2019s motor-car, and walk back by the river. Wouldn\u2019t that be best?\u201d That is the full account of my first brief visit to Brideshead; could I have known then that it would one day be remembered with tears by a middle-aged captain of infantry?Two T owards the end of that summer term I received the last visit and Grand Remonstrance of my cousin Jasper. I was just free of the schools, having taken the last paper of History Previous on the afternoon before; Jasper\u2019s subfusc suit and white tie proclaimed him still in the thick of it; he had, too, the exhausted but resentful air of one who fears he has failed to do himself full justice on the subject of Pindar\u2019s Orphism. Duty alone had brought him to my rooms that afternoon at great inconvenience to himself and, as it happened, to me, who, when he caught me in the door, was on my way to make final arrangements about a dinner I was giving that evening. It was one of several parties designed to comfort Hardcastle\u2014one of the tasks that had lately fallen to Sebastian and me since, by leaving his car out, we had got him into grave trouble with the proctors. Jasper would not sit down; this was to be no cozy chat; he stood with his back to the fireplace and, in his own phrase, talked to me \u2018like an uncle.\u2019 \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve tried to get in touch with you several times in the last week or two. In fact, I have the impression you are avoiding me. If that is so, Charles, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. \u201cYou may think it none of my business, but I feel a sense of responsibility. You know as well as I do that since your\u2014well, since the war, your father has not been really in touch with things\u2014lives in his own world. I don\u2019t want to sit back and see you making mistakes which a word in season might save you from. \u201cI expected you to make mistakes your first year. We all do. I got in with some thoroughly objectionable O.S.C.U. men who ran a mission to hop- pickers during the long vac. But you, my dear Charles, whether you realize it or not, have gone straight, hook, line and sinker, into the very worst set in the University . You may think that, living in digs, I don\u2019t know what goes on in college; but I hear things. In fact, I hear all too much. I find that I\u2019ve become a figure of mockery on your account at the Dining Club. There\u2019s that chap Sebastian Flyte you seem inseparable from. He may be all right, I don\u2019t know. His brother Brideshead was a very sound fellow. But this friend of yours looks odd to me and he gets himself talked about. Of course, they\u2019re an oddfamily. The Marchmains have lived apart since the war, you know. An extraordinary thing; everyone thought they were a devoted couple. Then he went off to France with his Yeomanry and just never came back. It was as if he\u2019d been killed. She\u2019s a Roman Catholic, so she can\u2019t get a divorce\u2014or won\u2019t , I expect. You can do anything at Rome with money, and they\u2019re enormously rich. Flyte may be all right, but Anthony Blanche \u2014now there\u2019s a man there\u2019s absolutely no excuse for.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t particularly like him myself,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, he\u2019s always hanging round here, and the stiffer element in college don\u2019t like it. They can\u2019t stand him at the House. He was in Mercury again last night. None of these people you go about with pull any weight in their own colleges, and that\u2019s the real test. They think because they\u2019ve got a lot of money to throw about, they can do anything. \u201cAnd that\u2019s another thing. I don\u2019t know what allowance my uncle makes you, but I don\u2019t mind betting you\u2019re spending double. All this ,\u201d he said, including in a wide sweep of his hand the evidence of profligacy about him. It was true; my room had cast its austere winter garments, and, by not very slow stages, assumed a richer wardrobe. \u201cIs that paid for?\u201d (the box of a hundred cabinet Partagas on the sideboard) \u201cor those ?\u201d (a dozen frivolous, new books on the table) \u201cor those?\u201d (a Lalique decanter and glasses) \u201cor that peculiarly noisome object?\u201d (a human skull lately purchased from the School of Medicine, which, resting in a bowl of roses, formed, at the moment, the chief decoration of my table. It bore the motto \u201cEt in Arcadia ego\u201d inscribed on its forehead). \u201cYes,\u201d I said, glad to be clear of one charge. \u201cI had to pay cash for the skull.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t be doing any work. Not that that matters, particularly if you\u2019re making something of your career elsewhere\u2014but are you? Have you spoken at the Union or at any of the clubs? Are you connected with any of the magazines? Are you even making a position in the O.U.D.S.? And your clothes !\u201d continued my cousin. \u201cWhen you came up I remember advising you to dress as you would in a country house. Your present get-up seems an unhappy compromise between the correct wear for a theatrical party at Maidenhead and a glee-singing competition in a garden suburb. \u201cAnd drink\u2014no one minds a man getting tight once or twice a term. In fact, he ought to, on certain occasions. But I hear you\u2019re constantly seen drunk in the middle of the afternoon.\u201d He paused, his duty discharged. Already the perplexities of the examination school were beginning to reassert themselves in his mind. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jasper,\u201d I said. \u201cI know it must be embarrassing for you, but Ihappen to like this bad set. I like getting drunk at luncheon, and though I haven\u2019t yet spent quite double my allowance, I undoubtedly shall before the end of term. I usually have a glass of champagne about this time. Will you join me?\u201d So my cousin Jasper despaired and, I learned later, wrote to his father on the subject of my excesses who, in his turn, wrote to my father, who took no action or particular thought in the matter, partly because he had disliked my uncle for nearly sixty years and partly because, as Jasper had said, he lived in his own world now, since my mother\u2019s death. Thus, in broad outline, Jasper sketched the more prominent features of my first year; some detail may be added on the same scale. I had committed myself earlier to spend the Easter vacation with Collins and, though I would have broken my word without compunction, and left my former friend friendless, had Sebastian made a sign, no sign was made; accordingly Collins and I spent several economical and instructive weeks together in Ravenna. A bleak wind blew from the Adriatic among those mighty tombs. In a hotel bedroom designed for a warmer season, I wrote long letters to Sebastian and called daily at the post office for his answers. There were two, each from a different address, neither giving any plain news of himself, for he wrote in a style of remote fantasy\u2014\u2026 \u201c Mummy and two attendant poets have three bad colds in the head, so I have come here. It is the feast of S. Nichodemus of Thyatira, who was martyred by having goatskin nailed to his pate, and is accordingly the patron of bald heads. Tell Collins, who I am sure will be bald before us. There are too many people here, but one, praise heaven! has an ear-trumpet, and that keeps me in good humor. And now I must try to catch a fish. It is too far to send it to you so I will keep the backbone\u2026\u201d \u2014which left me fretful. Collins made notes for a little thesis pointing out the inferiority of the original mosaics to their photographs. Here was planted the seed of what became his life\u2019s harvest. When, many years later, there appeared the first massive volume of his still unfinished work on Byzantine Art, I was touched to find among two pages of polite, preliminary acknowledgments of debt, my own name: \u201c\u2026 to Charles Ryder, with the aid of whose all-seeing eyes I first saw the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia and San Vitale\u2026\u201d I sometimes wonder whether, had it not been for Sebastian, I might have trodden the same path as Collins round the cultural water-wheel. My father in his youth sat for All Souls and, in a year of hot competition, failed; other successes and honors came his way later, but that early failure impressed itself on him, and through him on me, so that I came up with an ill-considered sense that there lay the proper and natural goal of the life of reason. I, too,should doubtless have failed, but, having failed, I might perhaps have slipped into a less august academic life elsewhere. It is conceivable, but not, I believe, likely, for the hot spring of anarchy rose from depths where was no solid earth, and burst into the sunlight\u2014a rainbow in its cooling vapors\u2014with a power the rocks could not repress. In the event, that Easter vacation formed a short stretch of level road in the precipitous descent of which Jasper warned me. Descent or ascent? It seems to me that I grew younger daily with each adult habit that I acquired. I had lived a lonely childhood and a boyhood straitened by war and overshadowed by bereavement; to the hard bachelordom of English adolescence, the premature dignity and authority of the school system, I had added a sad and grim strain of my own. Now, that summer term with Sebastian, it seemed as though I was being given a brief spell of what I had never known, a happy childhood, and though its toys were silk shirts and liqueurs and cigars and its naughtiness high in the catalogue of grave sins, there was something of nursery freshness about us that fell little short of the joy of innocence. At the end of the term I took my first schools; it was necessary to pass, if I was to remain at Oxford, and pass I did, after a week in which I forbade Sebastian my rooms and sat up to a late hour, with iced black coffee and charcoal biscuits, cramming myself with the neglected texts. I remember no syllable of them now, but the other, more ancient lore which I acquired that term will be with me in one shape or another to my last hour. \u201cI like this bad set and I like getting drunk at luncheon\u201d; that was enough then. Is more needed now? Looking back, now, after twenty years, there is little I would have left undone or done otherwise. I could match my cousin Jasper\u2019s game-cock maturity with a sturdier fowl. I could tell him that all the wickedness of that time was like the spirit they mix with the pure grape of the Douro, heady stuff full of dark ingredients; it at once enriched and retarded the whole process of adolescence as the spirit checks the fermentation of the wine, renders it undrinkable, so that it must lie in the dark, year in, year out, until it is brought up at last fit for the table. I could tell him, too, that to know and love one other human being is the root of all wisdom. But I felt no need for these sophistries as I sat before my cousin, saw him, freed from his inconclusive struggle with Pindar, in his dark gray suit, his white tie, his scholar\u2019s gown; heard his grave tones and, all the time, savored the gillyflowers in full bloom under my windows. I had my secret and sure defense, like a talisman worn in the bosom, felt for in the moment of danger, found and firmly grasped. So I told him what was not in fact the truth, that I usually had a glass of champagne about that time, andasked him to join me. On the day after Jasper\u2019s Grand Remonstrance I received another, in different terms and from an unexpected source. All the term I had been seeing rather more of Anthony Blanche than my liking for him warranted. I lived now among his friends, but our frequent meetings were more of his choosing than mine, for I held him in considerable awe. In years, he was barely my senior, but he seemed then to be burdened with the experience of the Wandering Jew. He was indeed a nomad of no nationality. An attempt had been made in his childhood to make an Englishman of him; he was two years at Eton; then in the middle of the war he had defied the submarines, rejoined his mother in the Argentine, and a clever and audacious school-boy was added to the valet, the maid, the two chauffeurs, the pekinese and the second husband. Criss-cross about the world he traveled with them, waxing in wickedness like a Hogarthian page boy. When peace came they returned to Europe, to hotels and furnished villas, spas, casinos and bathing beaches. At the age of fifteen, for a wager, he was disguised as a girl and taken to play at the big table in the Jockey Club at Buenos Aires; he dined with Proust and Gide and was on closer terms with Cocteau and Diaghilev; Firbank sent him his novels with fervent inscriptions; he had aroused three irreconcilable feuds in Capri; by his own account he had practiced black art in Cefal\u00f9 and had been cured of drug-taking in California and of an Oedipus complex in Vienna. At times we all seemed children beside him\u2014at most times, but not always, for there was a bluster and zest in Anthony which the rest of us had shed somewhere in our more leisured adolescence, on the playing field or in the school-room; his vices flourished less in the pursuit of pleasure than in the wish to shock, and in the midst of his polished exhibitions I was often reminded of an urchin I had once seen in Naples, capering derisively, with obscene, unambiguous gestures, before a party of English tourists; as he told the tale of his evening at the gaming table, one could see in the roll of his eye just how he had glanced, covertly, over the dwindling pile of chips at his step- father\u2019s party; while we had been rolling one another in the mud at football and gorging ourselves with crumpets, Anthony had helped oil fading beauties on sub-tropical sands and had sipped his ap\u00e9ritif in smart little bars, so that the savage we had tamed was still rampant in him. He was cruel, too, in thewanton, insect-maiming manner of the very young, and fearless like a little boy, charging, head down, small fists whirling, at the school prefects. He asked me to dinner, and I was a little disconcerted to find that we were to dine alone. \u201cWe are going to Thame,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a delightful hotel there, which luckily doesn\u2019t appeal to the Bullingdon. We will drink Rhine wine and imagine ourselves\u2026 where? Not on a j-j-jaunt with J-J-Jorrocks, anyway. But first we will have our ap\u00e9ritif.\u201d At the George bar he ordered \u201cFour Alexandra cocktails, please,\u201d ranged them before him with a loud \u201cYum-yum\u201d which drew every eye, outraged, upon him. \u201cI expect you would prefer sherry, but, my dear Charles, you are not going to have sherry. Isn\u2019t this a delicious concoction? You don\u2019t like it? Then I will drink it for you. One, two, three, four, down the red lane they go. How the students stare!\u201d And he led me out to the waiting motor-car. \u201cI hope we shall find no undergraduates there. I am a little out of sympathy with them for the moment. You heard about their treatment of me on Thursday? It was too naughty. Luckily I was wearing my oldest pajamas and it was an evening of oppressive heat, or I might have been seriously cross.\u201d Anthony had a habit of putting his face near one when he spoke; the sweet and creamy cocktail had tainted his breath. I leaned away from him in the corner of the hired car. \u201cPicture me, my dear, alone and studious. I had just bought a rather forbidding book called Antic Hay, which I knew I must read before going to Garsington on Sunday, because everyone was bound to talk about it, and it\u2019s so banal saying you have not read the book of the moment, if you haven\u2019t. The solution I suppose is not to go to Garsington, but that didn\u2019t occur to me until this moment. So , my dear, I had an omelet and a peach and a bottle of Vichy water and put on my pajamas and settled down to read. I must say my thoughts wandered, but I kept turning the pages and watching the light fade, which in Peckwater, my dear, is quite an experience\u2014as darkness falls the stone seems positively to decay under one\u2019s eyes. I was reminded of some of those leprous fa\u00e7ades in the vieux port at Marseille, until suddenly I was disturbed by such a bawling and caterwauling as you never heard, and there, down in the little piazza, I saw a mob of about twenty terrible young men, and do you know what they were chanting? \u2018We want Blanche. We want Blanche,\u2019 in a kind of litany. Such a public declaration! Well, I saw it was all up with Mr. Huxley for the evening, and I must say I had reached a point of tedium when any interruption was welcome. I was stirred by the bellows, but, do you know, the louder they shouted, the shyer they seemed? They kept saying \u2018Where\u2019s Boy?\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s Boy Mulcaster\u2019s friend,\u2019 \u2018Boy must bring him down.\u2019 Of course you\u2019ve met Boy? He\u2019s always popping in and out of dearSebastian\u2019s rooms. He\u2019s everything we dagos expect of an English lord. A great parti I can assure you. All the young ladies in London are after him. He\u2019s very hoity-toity with them, I\u2019m told. My dear, he\u2019s scared stiff. A great oaf\u2014that\u2019s Mulcaster\u2014and what\u2019s more, my dear, a cad . He came to Le Touquet at Easter and, in some extraordinary way, I seemed to have asked him to stay. He lost some infinitesimal sum at cards, and as a result expected me to pay for all his treats\u2014well, Mulcaster was in this party; I could see his ungainly form shuffling about below and hear him saying: \u2018It\u2019s no good. He\u2019s out. Let\u2019s go back and have a drink?\u2019 So then I put my head out of the window and called to him: \u2018Good evening, Mulcaster, old sponge and toady, are you lurking among the hobbledehoys? Have you came to repay me the three hundred francs I lent you for the poor drab you picked up in the Casino? It was a niggardly sum for her trouble, and what a trouble, Mulcaster. Come up and pay me, poor hooligan!\u2019 \u201cThat, my dear, seemed to put a little life into them, and up the stairs they came, clattering. About six of them came into my room, the rest stood mouthing outside. My dear, they looked too extraordinary. They had been having one of their ridiculous club dinners, and they were all wearing colored tail-coats\u2014a sort of livery. \u2018My dears,\u2019 I said to them, \u2018you look like a lot of most disorderly footmen.\u2019 Then one of them, rather a juicy little piece, accused me of unnatural vices. \u2018My dear,\u2019 I said, \u2018I may be inverted but I am not insatiable. Come back when you are alone .\u2019 Then they began to blaspheme in a very shocking manner, and suddenly I, too, began to be annoyed. \u2018Really,\u2019 I thought, \u2018when I think of all the hullabaloo there was when I was seventeen, and the Duc de Vincennes (old Armand, of course, not Philippe) challenged me to a duel for an affair of the heart, and very much more than the heart, I assure you, with the duchess (Stefanie, of course, not old Poppy)\u2014now, to submit to impertinence from these pimply, tipsy virgins\u2026 \u2019 Well, I gave up the light, bantering tone and let myself be just a little offensive. \u201cThen they began saying, \u2018Get hold of him. Put him in Mercury.\u2019 Now as you know I have two sculptures by Brancusi and several pretty things and I did not want them to start getting rough, so I said, pacifically, \u2018Dear sweet clodhoppers, if you knew anything of sexual psychology you would know that nothing could give me keener pleasure than to be manhandled by you meaty boys. It would be an ecstasy of the very naughtiest kind. So if any of you wishes to be my partner in joy come and seize me. If, on the other hand, you simply wish to satisfy some obscure and less easily classified libido and see me bathe, come with me quietly, dear louts, to the fountain.\u2019 \u201cDo you know, they all looked a little foolish at that? I walked down withthem and no one came within a yard of me. Then I got into the fountain and, you know, it was really most refreshing, so I sported there a little and struck some attitudes, until they turned about and walked sulkily home, and I heard Boy Mulcaster saying, \u2018Anyway, we did put him in Mercury.\u2019 You know, Charles, that is just what they\u2019ll be saying in thirty years\u2019 time. When they\u2019re all married to scraggy little women like hens and have cretinous porcine sons like themselves getting drunk at the same club dinner in the same colored coats, they\u2019ll still say, when my name is mentioned, \u2018We put him in Mercury one night,\u2019 and their barnyard daughters will snigger and think their father was quite a dog in his day, and what a pity he\u2019s grown so dull. Oh, la fatigue du Nord!\u201d It was not, I knew, the first time Anthony had been ducked, but the incident seemed much on his mind, for he reverted to it again at dinner. \u201cNow you can\u2019t imagine an unpleasantness like that happening to Sebastian, can you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said; I could",

I know mummy will make it seem she has to bear the whole brunt of the business.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s telephone Julia and get her to meet us somewhere and talk it over.\u201d We met at Gunter\u2019s in Berkeley Square. Julia, like most women then, wore a green hat pulled down to her eyes with a diamond arrow in it; she had a small dog under her arm, three-quarters buried in the fur of her coat. She greeted us with an unusual show of interest. \u201cWell, you are a pair of pickles; I must say you look remarkably well on it. The only time I got tight I was paralyzed all the next day. I do think you might have taken me with you. The ball was positively lethal, and I\u2019ve always longed to go to the Old Hundredth. No one will ever take me. Is it heaven?\u201d \u201cSo you know all about that, too?\u201d\u201cRex telephoned me this morning and told me everything. What were your girl friends like?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be prurient,\u201d said Sebastian. \u201cMine was like a skull.\u201d \u201cMine was like a consumptive.\u201d \u201cGoodness.\u201d It had clearly raised us in Julia\u2019s estimation that we had been out with women; to her they were the point of interest. \u201cDoes mummy know?\u201d \u201cNot about your skulls and consumptives. She knows you were in the clink. I told her. She was divine about it, of course. You know anything Uncle Ned did was always perfect, and he got locked up once for taking a bear into one of Lloyd George\u2019s meetings, so she really feels quite human about the whole thing. She wants you both to lunch with her.\u201d \u201cOh God!\u201d \u201cThe only trouble is the papers and the family. Have you got an awful family, Charles?\u201d \u201cOnly a father. He\u2019ll never hear about it.\u201d \u201cOurs are awful. Poor mummy is in for a ghastly time with them. They\u2019ll be writing letters and paying visits of sympathy, and all the time at the back of their minds one half will be saying, \u2018That\u2019s what comes of bringing the boy up a Catholic,\u2019 and the other half will say, \u2018That\u2019s what comes of sending him to Eton instead of Stonyhurst.\u2019 Poor mummy can\u2019t get it right.\u201d We lunched with Lady Marchmain. She accepted the whole thing with humorous resignation. Her only reproach was: \u201cI can\u2019t think why you went off and stayed with Mr. Mottram. You might have come and told me about it first.\u201d \u201cHow am I going to explain it to all the family?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey will be so shocked to find that they\u2019re more upset about it than I am. Do you know my sister-in-law, Fanny Rosscommon? She has always thought I brought the children up badly. Now I am beginning to think she must be right.\u201d When we left I said: \u201cShe couldn\u2019t have been more charming. What were you so worried about?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t explain,\u201d said Sebastian miserably. A week later when Sebastian came up for trial he was fined ten pounds. The newspapers reported it with painful prominence, one of them under the ironic headline: \u201c Marquis\u2019s son unused to wine .\u201d The magistrate said that it was only through the prompt action of the police that he was not up on a gravecharge\u2026 \u201cIt is purely by good fortune that you do not bear the responsibility of a serious accident\u2026\u201d Mr. Samgrass gave evidence that Sebastian bore an irreproachable character and that a brilliant future at the University was in jeopardy. The papers took hold of this too\u2014\u201c Model Student\u2019s Career at Stake .\u201d But for Mr. Samgrass\u2019s evidence, said the magistrate, he would have been disposed to give an exemplary sentence; the law was the same for an Oxford undergraduate as for any young hooligan; indeed the better the home the more shameful the offence\u2026 It was not only at Bow Street that Mr. Samgrass was of value. At Oxford he showed all the zeal and acumen which were Rex Mottram\u2019s in London. He interviewed the college authorities, the proctors, the Vice-Chancellor; he induced Mgr. Bell to call on the Dean of Christ Church; he arranged for Lady Marchmain to talk to the Chancellor himself; and, as a result of all this, the three of us were gated for the rest of the term. Hardcastle, for no very clear reason, was again deprived of the use of his car, and the affair blew over. The most lasting penalty we suffered was our intimacy with Rex Mottram and Mr. Samgrass, but since Rex\u2019s life was in London in a world of politics and high finance and Mr. Samgrass\u2019s nearer to our own at Oxford, it was from him we suffered the more. For the rest of that term he haunted us. Now that we were \u201cgated\u201d we could not spend our evenings together, and from nine o\u2019clock onwards were alone and at Mr. Samgrass\u2019s mercy. Hardly an evening seemed to pass but he called on one or the other of us. He spoke of \u201cour little escapade\u201d as though he, too, had been in the cells, and had that bond with us\u2026. Once I climbed out of college and Mr. Samgrass found me in Sebastian\u2019s rooms after the gate was shut and that, too, he made into a bond. It did not surprise me, therefore, when I arrived at Brideshead, after Christmas, to find Mr. Samgrass, as though in wait for me, sitting alone before the fire in the room they called the \u201cTapestry Hall.\u201d \u201cYou find me in solitary possession,\u201d he said, and indeed he seemed to possess the hall and the somber scenes of venery that hung round it, to possess the caryatids on either side of the fireplace, to possess me, as he rose to take my hand and greet me like a host: \u201cThis morning,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe had a lawn meet of the Marchmain Hounds\u2014a deliciously archaic spectacle \u2014and all our young friends are fox-hunting, even Sebastian who, you will not be surprised to hear, looked remarkably elegant in his pink coat. Brideshead was impressive rather than elegant; he is Joint-Master with a local figure of fun named Sir Walter Strickland-Venables. I wish the two of them could be included in these rather humdrum tapestries\u2014they would give a note of fantasy.\u201cOur hostess remained at home; also a convalescent Dominican who has read too much Maritain and too little Hegel; Sir Adrian Porson, of course, and two rather forbidding Magyar cousins\u2014I have tried them in German and in French, but in neither tongue are they diverting. All these have now driven off to visit a neighbor. I have been spending a cozy afternoon before the fire with the incomparable Charlus. Your arrival emboldens me to ring for some tea. How can I prepare you for the party? Alas, it breaks up tomorrow. Lady Julia departs to celebrate the New Year elsewhere, and takes the beau-monde with her. I shall miss the pretty creatures about the house\u2014particularly one Celia; she is the sister of our old companion in adversity, Boy Mulcaster, and wonderfully unlike him. She has a bird-like style of conversation, pecking away at the subject in a way I find most engaging, and a school-monitor style of dress which I can only call \u2018saucy.\u2019 I shall miss her, for I do not go tomorrow. Tomorrow I start work in earnest on our hostess\u2019s book\u2014which, believe me, is a treasure-house of period gems; pure authentic 1914.\u201d Tea was brought and, soon after it, Sebastian returned; he had lost the hunt early, he said, and hacked home; the others were not long after him, having been fetched by car at the end of the day; Brideshead was absent; he had business at the kennels and Cordelia had gone with him. The rest filled the hall and were soon eating scrambled eggs and crumpets; and Mr. Samgrass, who had lunched at home and dozed all the afternoon before the fire, ate eggs and crumpets with them. Presently Lady Marchmain\u2019s party returned, and when, before we went upstairs to dress for dinner, she said \u201cWho\u2019s coming to chapel for the Rosary?\u201d and Sebastian and Julia said they must have their baths at once, Mr. Samgrass went with her and the friar. \u201cI wish Mr. Samgrass would go,\u201d said Sebastian, in his bath; \u201cI\u2019m sick of being grateful to him.\u201d In the course of the next fortnight distaste for Mr. Samgrass came to be a little unspoken secret throughout the house; in his presence Sir Adrian Porson\u2019s fine old eyes seemed to search a distant horizon and his lips set in classic pessimism. Only the Hungarian cousins who, mistaking the status of tutor, took him for an unusually privileged upper servant, were unaffected by his presence. Mr. Samgrass, Sir Adrian Porson, the Hungarians, the friar, Brideshead, Sebastian, Cordelia were all who remained of the Christmas party. Religion predominated in the house; not only in its practices\u2014the daily mass and Rosary, morning and evening in the chapel\u2014but in all itsintercourse. \u201cWe must make a Catholic of Charles,\u201d Lady Marchmain said, and we had many little talks together during my visits when she delicately steered the subject into a holy quarter. After the first of these Sebastian said: \u201cHas mummy been having one of her \u2018little talks\u2019 with you? She\u2019s always doing it. I wish to hell she wouldn\u2019t.\u201d One was never summoned for a little talk, or consciously led to it; it merely happened, when she wished to speak intimately, that one found oneself alone with her, if it was summer, in a secluded walk by the lakes or in a corner of the walled rose-gardens; if it was winter, in her sitting-room on the first floor. This room was all her own; she had taken it for herself and changed it so that, entering, one seemed to be in another house. She had lowered the ceiling and the elaborate cornice which, in one form or another, graced every room was lost to view; the walls, one paneled in brocade, were stripped and washed blue and spotted with innumerable little water-colors of fond association; the air was sweet with the fresh scent of flowers and musty potpourri; her library in soft leather covers, well-read works of poetry and piety, filled a small rosewood bookcase; the chimneypiece was covered with small personal treasures\u2014an ivory Madonna, a plaster St. Joseph, posthumous miniatures of her three soldier brothers. When Sebastian and I lived alone at Brideshead during that brilliant August we had kept out of his mother\u2019s room. Scraps of conversation come back to me with the memory of her room. I remember her saying: \u201cWhen I was a girl we were comparatively poor, but still much richer than most of the world, and when I married I became very rich. It used to worry me, and I thought it wrong to have so many beautiful things when others had nothing. Now I realize that it is possible for the rich to sin by coveting the privileges of the poor. The poor have always been the favorites of God and his saints, but I believe that it is one of the special achievements of Grace to sanctify the whole of life, riches included. Wealth in pagan Rome was necessarily something cruel; it\u2019s not anymore.\u201d I said something about a camel and the eye of a needle and she rose happily to the point. \u201cBut of course ,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s very unexpected for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, but the gospel is simply a catalogue of unexpected things. It\u2019s not to be expected that an ox and an ass should worship at the crib. Animals are always doing the oddest things in the lives of the saints. It\u2019s all part of the poetry, the Alice-in-Wonderland side, of religion.\u201d But I was as untouched by her faith as I was by her charm: or, rather, I was touched by both alike. I had no mind then for anything except Sebastian, and I saw him already as being threatened, though I did not yet know how blackwas the threat. His constant, despairing prayer was to be let alone. By the blue waters and rustling palms of his own mind he was happy and harmless as a Polynesian; only when the big ship dropped anchor beyond the coral reef, and the cutter beached in the lagoon, and, up the slope that had never known the print of a boot, there trod the grim invasion of trader, administrator, missionary, and tourist\u2014only then was it time to disinter the archaic weapons of the tribe and sound the drums in the hills; or, more easily, to turn from the sunlit door and lie alone in the darkness, where the impotent, painted deities paraded the walls in vain, and cough his heart out among the rum bottles. And since Sebastian counted among the intruders his own conscience and all claims of human affection, his days in Arcadia were numbered. For in this, to me, tranquil time Sebastian took fright. I knew him well in that mood of alertness and suspicion, like a deer suddenly lifting his head at the far notes of the hunt; I had seen him grow wary at the thought of his family or his religion, now I found I, too, was suspect. He did not fail in love, but he lost his joy of it, for I was no longer part of his solitude. As my intimacy with his family grew, I became part of the world which he sought to escape; I became one of the bonds which held him. That was the part for which his mother, in all our little talks, was seeking to fit me. Everything was left unsaid. It was only dimly and at rare moments that I suspected what was afoot. Outwardly Mr. Samgrass was the only enemy. For a fortnight Sebastian and I remained at Brideshead, leading our own life. His brother was engaged in sport and estate management; Mr. Samgrass was at work in the library on Lady Marchmain\u2019s book; Sir Adrian Porson demanded most of Lady Marchmain\u2019s time. We saw little of them except in the evenings; there was room under that wide roof for a wide variety of independent lives. After a fortnight Sebastian said: \u201cI can\u2019t stand Mr. Samgrass anymore. Let\u2019s go to London,\u201d so he came to stay with me and now began to use my home in preference to \u201cMarchers.\u201d My father liked him. \u201cI think your friend very amusing,\u201d he said. \u201cAsk him often .\u201d Then, back at Oxford, we took up again the life that seemed to be shrinking in the cold air. The sadness that had been strong in Sebastian the term before gave place to a kind of sullenness even towards me. He was sick at heart somewhere, I did not know how, and I grieved for him, unable to help. When he was gay now it was usually because he was drunk, and when drunk he developed an obsession of \u201cmocking Mr. Samgrass.\u201d He composed a ditty of which the refrain was, \u201cGreen arse, Samgrass\u2014Samgrass green arse,\u201dsung to the tune of St. Mary\u2019s chime, and he would thus serenade him, perhaps once a week, under his windows. Mr. Samgrass was distinguished as being the first don to have a private telephone installed in his rooms. Sebastian in his cups used to ring him up and sing him this simple song. And all this Mr. Samgrass took in good part, as it is called, smiling obsequiously when we met, but with growing confidence, as though each outrage in some way strengthened his hold on Sebastian. It was during this term that I began to realize that Sebastian was a drunkard in quite a different sense to myself. I got drunk often, but through an excess of high spirits, in the love of the moment, and the wish to prolong and enhance it; Sebastian drank to escape. As we together grew older and more serious I drank less, he more. I found that sometimes after I had gone back to my college, he sat up late and alone, soaking. A succession of disasters came on him so swiftly and with such unexpected violence that it is hard to say when exactly I recognized that my friend was in deep trouble. I knew it well enough in the Easter vacation. Julia used to say, \u201cPoor Sebastian. It\u2019s something chemical in him.\u201d That was the cant phrase of the time, derived from heaven knows what misconception of popular science. \u201cThere\u2019s something chemical between them\u201d was used to explain the over-mastering hate or love of any two people. It was the old concept of determinism in a new form. I do not believe there was anything chemical in my friend. The Easter party at Brideshead was a bitter time, culminating in a small but unforgettably painful incident. Sebastian got very drunk before dinner in his mother\u2019s house, and thus marked the beginning of a new epoch in his melancholy record, another stride in the flight from his family which brought him to ruin. It was at the end of the day when the large Easter party left Brideshead. It was called the Easter party, though in fact it began on the Tuesday of Easter Week, for the Flytes all went into retreat at the guest-house of a monastery from Maundy Thursday until Easter. This year Sebastian had said he would not go, but at the last moment had yielded, and came home in a state of acute depression from which I totally failed to raise him. He had been drinking very hard for a week\u2014only I knew how hard\u2014and drinking in a nervous, surreptitious way, totally unlike his old habit. During the party there was always a grog tray in the library, and Sebastian took to slipping in there at odd moments during the day without saying anything even to me. The house was largely deserted during the day. I was at work painting another panel in the little garden-room in the colonnade. Sebastian complained of a cold, stayed in, and during all that time was never quitesober; he escaped attention by being silent. Now and then I noticed him attract curious glances, but most of the party knew him too slightly to see the change in him, while his own family were occupied, each with their particular guests. When I remonstrated he said, \u201cI can\u2019t stand all these people about,\u201d but it was when they finally left and he had to face his family at close quarters that he broke down. The normal practice was for a cocktail tray to be brought into the drawing- room at six; we mixed our own drinks and the bottles were removed when we went to dress; later, just before dinner, cocktails appeared again, this time handed round by the footmen. Sebastian disappeared after tea; the light had gone and I spent the next hour playing mah-jongg with Cordelia. At six I was alone in the drawing- room, when he returned; he was frowning in a way I knew all too well, and when he spoke I recognized the drunken thickening in his voice. \u201cHaven\u2019t they brought the cocktails yet?\u201d He pulled clumsily on the bell- rope. I said, \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d \u201cUp with nanny.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. You\u2019ve been drinking somewhere.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been reading in my room. My cold\u2019s worse today.\u201d When the tray arrived he slopped gin and vermouth into a tumbler and carried it out of the room with him. I followed him upstairs, where he shut his bedroom door in my face and turned the key. I returned to the drawing-room full of dismay and foreboding. The family assembled. Lady Marchmain said: \u201cWhat\u2019s become of Sebastian?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s gone to lie down. His cold is worse.\u201d \u201cOh dear, I hope he isn\u2019t getting \u2019flu. I thought he had a feverish look once or twice lately. Is there anything he wants?\u201d \u201cNo, he particularly asked not to be disturbed.\u201d I wondered whether I ought to speak to Brideshead, but that grim, rock- crystal mask forbade all confidence. Instead, on the way upstairs to dress, I told Julia. \u201cSebastian\u2019s drunk.\u201d \u201cHe can\u2019t be. He didn\u2019t even come for a cocktail.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s been drinking in his room all the afternoon.\u201d \u201cHow very peculiar! What a bore he is! Will he be all right for dinner?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWell, you must deal with him. It\u2019s no business of mine. Does he often dothis?\u201d \u201cHe has lately.\u201d \u201cHow very boring.\u201d I tried Sebastian\u2019s door, found it locked, and hoped he was sleeping, but, when I came back from my bath, I found him sitting in the chair before my fire; he was dressed for dinner, all but his shoes, but his tie was awry and his hair on end; he was very red in the face and squinting slightly. He spoke indistinctly. \u201cCharles, what you said was quite true. Not with nanny. Been drinking whisky up here. None in the library now party\u2019s gone. Now party\u2019s gone and only mummy. Feeling rather drunk. Think I\u2019d better have something-on-a-tray up here. Not dinner with mummy.\u201d \u201cGo to bed,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019ll say your cold\u2019s worse.\u201d \u201cMuch worse.\u201d I took him to his room which was next to mine and tried to get him to bed, but he sat in front of his dressing table squinnying at himself in the glass, trying to remake his bow-tie. On the writing table by the fire was a half-empty decanter of whisky. I took it up, thinking he would not see, but he spun round from the mirror and said: \u201cYou put that down.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be an ass, Sebastian. You\u2019ve had enough.\u201d \u201cWhat the devil\u2019s it got to do with you? You\u2019re only a guest here\u2014 my guest. I drink what I want to in my own house.\u201d He would have fought me for it at that moment. \u201cVery well,\u201d I said, putting the decanter back, \u201conly for God\u2019s sake keep out of sight.\u201d \u201cOh, mind your own business. You came here as my friend; now you\u2019re spying on me for my mother, I know. Well, you can get out, and tell her from me that I\u2019ll choose my friends and she her spies in future.\u201d So I left him and went down to dinner. \u201cI\u2019ve been in to Sebastian,\u201d I said. \u201cHis cold has come on rather badly. He\u2019s gone to bed and says he doesn\u2019t want anything.\u201d \u201cPoor Sebastian,\u201d said Lady Marchmain. \u201cHe\u2019d better have a glass of hot whisky. I\u2019ll go and have a look at him.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t mummy, I\u2019ll go,\u201d said Julia rising. \u201c I\u2019ll go,\u201d said Cordelia, who was dining down that night, for a treat to celebrate the departure of the guests. She was at the door and through it before anyone could stop her. Julia caught my eye and gave a tiny, sad shrug. In a few minutes Cordelia was back, looking grave. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t seem to want anything,\u201d she said.\u201cHow was he?\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know , but I think he\u2019s very drunk,\u201d she said. \u201cCordelia.\u201d Suddenly the child began to giggle. \u201c \u2018Marquis\u2019s Son Unused to Wine,\u2019 \u201d she quoted. \u201c \u2018Model Student\u2019s Career Threatened.\u2019 \u201d \u201cCharles, is this true?\u201d asked Lady Marchmain. \u201cYes.\u201d Then dinner was announced, and we went to the dining-room where the subject was not mentioned. When Brideshead and I were left alone he said: \u201cDid you say Sebastian was drunk?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cExtraordinary time to choose. Couldn\u2019t you stop him?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Brideshead, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could. I once saw my father drunk, in this room. I wasn\u2019t more than about ten at the time. You can\u2019t stop people if they want to get drunk. My mother couldn\u2019t stop my father, you know.\u201d He spoke in his odd, impersonal way. The more I saw of this family, I reflected, the more singular I found them. \u201cI shall ask my mother to read to us tonight.\u201d It was the custom, I learned later, always to ask Lady Marchmain to read aloud on evenings of family tension. She had a beautiful voice and great humor of expression. That night she read part of The Wisdom of Father Brown . Julia sat with a stool covered with manicure things and carefully revarnished her nails; Cordelia nursed Julia\u2019s pekinese; Brideshead played patience; I sat unoccupied studying the pretty group they made, and mourning my friend upstairs. But the horrors of that evening were not yet over. It was sometimes Lady Marchmain\u2019s practice, when the family were alone, to visit the chapel before going to bed. She had just closed her book and proposed going there when the door opened and Sebastian appeared. He was dressed as I had last seen him, but now instead of being flushed he was deathly pale. \u201cCome to apologize,\u201d he said. \u201cSebastian, dear, do go back to your room,\u201d said Lady Marchmain. \u201cWe can talk about it in the morning.\u201d \u201cNot to you. Come to apologize to Charles. I was bloody to him and he\u2019s my guest. He\u2019s my guest and my only friend and I was bloody to him.\u201d A chill spread over us. I led him back to his room; his family went to theirprayers. I noticed when we got upstairs that the decanter was now empty. \u201cIt\u2019s time you were in bed,\u201d I said. Sebastian began to weep. \u201cWhy do you take their side against me? I knew you would if I let you meet them. Why do you spy on me?\u201d He said more than I can bear to remember, even at twenty years\u2019 distance. At last I got him to sleep and very sadly went to bed myself. Next morning, he came to my room very early, while the house still slept; he drew the curtains and the sound of it woke me, to find him there fully dressed, smoking, with his back to me, looking out of the windows to where the long dawn-shadows lay across the dew and the first birds were chattering in the budding tree-tops. When I spoke he turned a face which showed no ravages of the evening before, but was fresh and sullen as a disappointed child\u2019s. \u201cWell,\u201d I said. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d \u201cRather odd. I think perhaps I\u2019m still a little drunk. I\u2019ve just been down to the stables trying to get a car but everything was locked. We\u2019re off.\u201d He drank from the water-bottle by my pillow, threw his cigarette from the window, and lit another with hands which trembled like an old man\u2019s. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. London, I suppose. Can I come and stay with you?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d \u201cWell, get dressed. They can send our luggage on by train.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t just go like this.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t stay.\u201d He sat on the window seat looking away from me, out of the window. Presently he said: \u201cThere\u2019s smoke coming from some of the chimneys. They must have opened the stables now. Come on.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t go,\u201d I said. \u201cI must say good-bye to your mother.\u201d \u201cSweet bulldog.\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t happen to like running away.\u201d \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t care less. And I shall go on running away, as far and as fast as I can. You can hatch up any plot you like with my mother; I shan\u2019t come back.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how you talked last night.\u201d \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry, Charles. I told you I was still drunk. If it\u2019s any comfort to you, I absolutely detest myself.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no comfort at all.\u201d \u201cIt must be a little, I should have thought. Well, if you won\u2019t come, give my love to nanny.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re really going?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d \u201cShall I see you in London?\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019m coming to stay with you.\u201d He left me but I did not sleep again; nearly two hours later a footman came with tea and bread and butter and set my clothes out for a new day. Later that morning I sought Lady Marchmain; the wind had freshened and we stayed indoors; I sat near her before the fire in her room, while she bent over her needlework and the budding creeper rattled on the window panes. \u201cI wish I had not seen him,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was cruel. I do not mind the idea of his being drunk. It is a thing all men do when they are young. I am used to the idea of it. My brothers were wild at his age. What hurt last night was that there was nothing happy about him.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him like that before.\u201d \u201cAnd last night of all nights\u2026 when everyone had gone and there were only ourselves here\u2014you see, Charles, I look on you very much as one of ourselves. Sebastian loves you\u2014when there was no need for him to make an effort to be gay. And he wasn\u2019t gay. I slept very little last night, and all the time I kept coming back to that one thing; he was so unhappy.\u201d It was impossible for me to explain to her what I only half understood myself; even then I felt, \u201cShe will learn it soon enough. Perhaps she knows it now.\u201d \u201cIt was horrible,\u201d I said. \u201cBut please don\u2019t think that\u2019s his usual way.\u201d \u201cMr. Samgrass told me he was drinking too much all last term.\u201d \u201cYes, but not like that\u2014never before.\u201d \u201cThen why now? here? with us? All night I have been thinking and praying and wondering what I was to say to him, and now, this morning, he isn\u2019t here at all. That was cruel of him, leaving without a word. I don\u2019t want him to be ashamed\u2014it\u2019s being ashamed that makes it all so wrong of him.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s ashamed of being unhappy,\u201d I said. \u201cMr. Samgrass says he is noisy and high-spirited. I believe,\u201d she said, with a faint light of humor streaking the clouds, \u201cI believe you and he tease Mr. Samgrass rather. It\u2019s naughty of you. I\u2019m very fond of Mr. Samgrass, and you should be too, after all he\u2019s done for you. But I think perhaps if I were your age and a man, I might be just a little inclined to tease Mr. Samgrass myself. No, I don\u2019t mind that, but last night and this morning are something quite different. You see, it\u2019s all happened before .\u201d \u201cI can only say I\u2019ve seen him drunk often and I\u2019ve been drunk with himoften, but last night was quite new to me.\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t mean with Sebastian. I mean years ago. I\u2019ve been through it all before with someone else whom I loved. Well, you must know what I mean\u2014with his father. He used to be drunk in just that way. Someone told me he is not like that now. I pray God it\u2019s true and thank God for it with all my heart, if it is. But the running away\u2014he ran away, too, you know. It was as you said just now, he was ashamed of being unhappy. Both of them unhappy, ashamed and running away. It\u2019s too pitiful. The men I grew up with\u201d\u2014and her great eyes moved from the embroidery to the three miniatures in the folding leather case on the chimneypiece\u2014\u201cwere not like that. I simply don\u2019t understand it. Do you, Charles?\u201d \u201cOnly very little.\u201d \u201cAnd yet Sebastian is fonder of you than of any of us, you know. You\u2019ve got to help him. I can\u2019t.\u201d I have here compressed into a few sentences what, there, required many. Lady Marchmain was not diffuse, but she took hold of her subject in a feminine, flirtatious way, circling, approaching, retreating, feinting; she hovered over it like a butterfly; she played \u201cgrandmother\u2019s steps\u201d with it, getting nearer the real point imperceptibly while one\u2019s back was turned, standing rooted when she was observed. The unhappiness, the running away \u2014these made up her sorrow, and in her own way she exposed the whole of it, before she was done. It was an hour before she had said all she meant to say. Then, as I rose to leave her, she added as though in an afterthought: \u201cI wonder have you seen my brothers\u2019 book? It has just come out.\u201d I told her I had looked through it in Sebastian\u2019s rooms. \u201cI should like you to have a copy. May I give you one? They were three splendid men; Ned was the best of them. He was the last to be killed, and when the telegram came, as I knew it would come, I thought: \u201cNow it\u2019s my son\u2019s turn to do what Ned can never do now.\u201d I was alone then. He was just going to Eton. If you read Ned\u2019s book you\u2019ll understand.\u201d She had a copy lying ready on her bureau. I thought at the time, \u201cShe planned this parting before ever I came in. Had she rehearsed all the interview? If things had gone differently would she have put the book back in the drawer?\u201d She wrote her name and mine on the fly leaf, the date and place. \u201cI prayed for you, too, in the night,\u201d she said. I closed the door behind me, shutting out the bondieuserie , the low ceiling, the chintz, the lambskin bindings, the views of Florence, the bowls of hyacinth and potpourri, the petit-point , the intimate feminine, modern world and was back under the coved and coffered roof, the columns and entablatureof the central hall, in the august, masculine atmosphere of a better age. I was no fool; I was old enough to know that an attempt had been made to suborn me and young enough to have found the experience agreeable. I did not see Julia that morning, but just as I was leaving Cordelia ran to the door of the car and said: \u201cWill you be seeing Sebastian? Please give him my special love. Will you remember\u2014my special love?\u201d In the train to London I read the book Lady Marchmain had given me. The frontispiece reproduced the photograph of a young man in Grenadier uniform, and I saw plainly revealed there the origin of that grim mask which, in Brideshead, overlaid the gracious features of his father\u2019s family; this was a man of the woods and caves, a hunter, a judge of the tribal council, the repository of the harsh traditions of a people at war with their environment. There were other illustrations in the book, snapshots of the three brothers on holiday, and in each I traced the same archaic lines; and remembering Lady Marchmain, starry and delicate, I could find no likeness to her in these somber men. She appeared seldom in the book; she was older than the eldest of them by nine years and had married and left home while they were schoolboys; between her and them stood two other sisters; after the birth of the third daughter there had been pilgrimages and pious benefactions in request for a son, for theirs was a wide property and an ancient name; male heirs had come late and, when they came, in a profusion which at the time seemed to promise continuity to the line which, in the tragic event, ended abruptly with them. The family history was typical of the Catholic squires of England; from Elizabeth\u2019s reign till Victoria\u2019s they lived sequestered lives, among their tenantry and kinsmen, sending their sons to school abroad, often marrying there, inter-marrying, if not, with a score of families like themselves, debarred from all preferment, and learning, in those lost generations, lessons which could still be read in the lives of the last three men of the house. Mr. Samgrass\u2019s deft editorship had assembled and arranged a curiously homogeneous little body of writing\u2014poetry, letters, scraps of a journal, an unpublished essay or two, which all exhaled the same high-spirited, serious, chivalrous, other-worldly air and the letters from their contemporaries, written after their deaths, all in varying degrees of articulateness, told the same tale of men who were, in all the full flood of academic and athletic success, of popularity and the promise of great rewards ahead, seen somehow as set apart from their fellows, garlanded victims, devoted to the sacrifice. These menmust die to make a world for Hooper; they were the aborigines, vermin by right of law, to be shot off at leisure so that things might be safe for the traveling salesman, with his polygonal pince-nez, his fat wet hand-shake, his grinning dentures. I wondered, as the train carried me farther and farther from Lady Marchmain, whether perhaps there was not on her, too, the same blaze, marking her and hers for destruction by other ways than war. Did she see a sign in the red center of her cozy grate and hear it in the rattle of creeper on the window-pane, this whisper of doom? Then I reached Paddington and, returning home, found Sebastian there, and the sense of tragedy vanished, for he was gay and free as when I first met him. \u201cCordelia sent you her special love.\u201d \u201cDid you have a \u2018little talk\u2019 with mummy?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHave you gone over to her side?\u201d The day before I would have said: \u201cThere aren\u2019t two sides\u201d; that day I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m with you, \u2018Sebastian contra mundum .\u2019 \u201d And that was all the conversation we had on the subject, then or ever. But the shadows were closing round Sebastian. We returned to Oxford and once again the gillyflowers bloomed under my windows and the chestnut lit the streets and the warm stones strewed their flakes upon the cobble; but it was not as it had been; there was mid-winter in Sebastian\u2019s heart. The weeks went by; we looked for lodgings for the coming term and found them in Merton Street, a secluded, expensive little house near the tennis court. Meeting Mr. Samgrass, whom we had seen less often of late, I told him of our choice. He was standing at the table in Blackwell\u2019s where recent German books were displayed, setting aside a little heap of purchases. \u201cYou\u2019re sharing digs with Sebastian?\u201d he said. \u201cSo he is coming up next term?\u201d \u201cI suppose so. Why shouldn\u2019t he be?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why; I somehow thought perhaps he wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m always wrong about things like that. I like Merton Street.\u201d He showed me the books he was buying, which, since I knew no German, were not of interest to me. As I left him he said: \u201cDon\u2019t think me interfering, you know, but I shouldn\u2019t make any definite arrangement in Merton Street until you\u2019re sure.\u201d I told Sebastian of this conversation and he said: \u201cYes, there\u2019s a plot on.Mummy wants me to go and live with Mgr. Bell.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about it?\u201d \u201cBecause I\u2019m not going to live with Mgr. Bell.\u201d \u201cI still think you might have told me. When did it start?\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s been going on. Mummy\u2019s very clever, you know. She saw she\u2019d failed with you. I expect it was the letter you wrote after reading Uncle Ned\u2019s book.\u201d \u201cI hardly said anything.\u201d \u201cThat was it. If you were going to be any help to her, you would have said a lot. Uncle Ned is the test, you know.\u201d But it seemed she had not quite despaired, for a few days later I got a note from her which said: \u201cI shall be passing through Oxford on Tuesday and hope to see you and Sebastian. I would like to see you alone for five minutes before I see him. Is that too much to ask? I will come to your rooms at about twelve.\u201d She came; she admired my rooms\u2026. \u201cMy brothers Simon and Ned were here, you know. Ned had rooms on the garden front. I wanted Sebastian to come here, too, but my husband was at Christ Church and, as you know, he took charge of Sebastian\u2019s education\u201d; she admired my drawings\u2026 \u201c everyone loves your paintings in the garden-room. We shall never forgive you if you don\u2019t finish them.\u201d Finally, she came to her point. \u201cI expect you\u2019ve guessed already what I have come to ask. Quite simply, is Sebastian drinking too much this term?\u201d I had guessed; I answered: \u201cIf he were, I shouldn\u2019t answer. As it is, I can say, \u2018No.\u2019 \u201d She said: \u201cI believe you. Thank God!\u201d and we went together to luncheon at Christ Church. That night Sebastian had his third disaster and was found by the junior dean at one o\u2019clock, wandering round Tom Quad hopelessly drunk. I had left him morose but completely sober at a few minutes before twelve. In the succeeding hour he had drunk half a bottle of whisky alone. He did not remember much about it when he came to tell me next morning. \u201cHave you been doing that a lot,\u201d I asked, \u201cdrinking by yourself after I\u2019ve gone?\u201d \u201cAbout twice; perhaps four times. It\u2019s only when they start bothering me. I\u2019d be all right if they\u2019d only leave me alone.\u201d \u201cThey won\u2019t now,\u201d I said. \u201cI know.\u201d We both knew that this was a crisis. I had no love for Sebastian that morning; he needed it, but I had none to give.\u201cReally,\u201d I said, \u201cif you are going to embark on a solitary bout of drinking every time you see a member of your family, it\u2019s perfectly hopeless.\u201d \u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Sebastian with great sadness. \u201cI know . It\u2019s hopeless.\u201d But my pride was stung because I had been made to look a liar and I could not respond to his need. \u201cWell, what do you propose to do?\u201d \u201cI shan\u2019t do anything. They\u2019ll do it all.\u201d And I let him go without comfort. Then the machinery began to move again, and I saw it all repeated as it had happened in December; Mr. Samgrass and Mgr. Bell saw the Dean of Christ Church; Brideshead came up for a night; the heavy wheels stirred and the small wheels spun. Everyone was exceedingly sorry for Lady Marchmain, whose brothers\u2019 names stood in letters of gold on the war memorial, whose brothers\u2019 memory was fresh in many breasts. She came to see me and, again, I must reduce to a few words a conversation which took us from Holywell to the Parks, through Mesopotamia, and over the ferry to north Oxford, where she was staying the night with a houseful of nuns who were in some way under her protection. \u201cYou must believe,\u201d I said, \u201cthat when I told you Sebastian was not drinking, I was telling you the truth, as I knew it.\u201d \u201cI know you wish to be a good friend to him.\u201d \u201cThat is not what I mean. I believed what I told you. I still believe it to some extent. I believe he has been drunk two or three times before, not more.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no good, Charles,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you can mean is that you have not as much influence or knowledge of him as I thought. It is no good either of us trying to believe him. I\u2019ve known drunkards before. One of the most terrible things about them is their deceit. Love of truth is the first thing that goes. \u201cAfter that happy luncheon together. When you left he was so sweet to me, just as he used to be as a little boy, and I agreed to all he wanted. You know I had been doubtful about his sharing rooms with you. I know you\u2019ll understand me when I say that. You know that we are all fond of you apart from your being Sebastian\u2019s friend. We should miss you so much if you ever stopped coming to stay with us. But I want Sebastian to have all sorts of friends, not just one. Mgr. Bell tells me he never mixes with the other Catholics, never goes to the Newman, very rarely goes to mass even. Heaven forbid that he should only know Catholics, but he must know some . It needs a very strong faith to stand entirely alone and Sebastian\u2019s isn\u2019t strong. \u201cBut I was so happy at luncheon on Tuesday that I gave up all my objections; I went round with him and saw the rooms you had chosen. They are charming. And we decided on some furniture you could have fromLondon to make them nicer. And then, on the very night after I had seen him! \u2014No Charles, it is not in the Logic of the Thing.\u201d As she said it I thought, \u201cThat\u2019s a phrase she\u2019s picked up from one of her intellectual hangers-on.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201chave you a remedy?\u201d \u201cThe college are being extraordinarily kind. They say they will not send him down provided he goes to live with Mgr. Bell. It\u2019s not a thing I could have suggested myself, but it was the Monsignor\u2019s own idea. He specially sent a message to you to say how welcome you would always be. There\u2019s not room for you actually in the Old Palace, but I daresay you wouldn\u2019t want that yourself.\u201d \u201cLady Marchmain, if you want to make him a drunkard that\u2019s the way to do it. Don\u2019t you see that any idea of his being watched would be fatal?\u201d \u201cOh, dear, it\u2019s no good trying to explain. Protestants always think Catholic priests are spies.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mean that.\u201d I tried to explain but made a poor business of it. \u201cHe must feel free.\u201d \u201cBut he\u2019s been free, always, up till now, and look at the result.\u201d We had reached the ferry; we had reached a deadlock. With scarcely another word I saw her to the convent, then took the bus back to Carfax. Sebastian was in my rooms waiting for",

      "chapter_text": "itwas one of the largest in the ship, our room was soon painfully crowded; they began to put out their cigarettes in the little pool of ice-water which now surrounded the swan. The purser made a sensation, as sailors like to do, by predicting a storm. \u201cHow can you be so beastly?\u201d asked my wife, conveying the flattering suggestion that not only the cabin and the caviar, but the waves, too, were at his command. \u201cAnyway, storms don\u2019t affect a ship like this, do they?\u201d \u201cMight hold us back a bit.\u201d \u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t make us sick?\u201d \u201cDepends if you\u2019re a good sailor. I\u2019m always sick in storms, ever since I was a boy.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s just being sadistic. Come over here, there\u2019s something I want to show you.\u201d It was the latest photograph of her children. \u201cCharles hasn\u2019t even seen Caroline yet. Isn\u2019t it thrilling for him?\u201d There were no friends of mine there, but I knew about a third of the party, and talked away civilly enough. An elderly woman said to me, \u201cSo you\u2019re Charles. I feel I know you through and through, Celia\u2019s talked so much about you.\u201d \u201cThrough and through,\u201d I thought. \u201cThrough and through is a long way, madam. Can you indeed see into those dark places where my own eyes seek in vain to guide me? Can you tell me, dear Mrs. Stuyvesant Oglander\u2014if I am correct in thinking that is how I heard my wife speak of you\u2014why it is that at this moment, while I talk to you, here, about my forthcoming exhibition, I am thinking all the time only of when Julia will come? Why can I talk like this to you, but not to her? Why have I already set her apart from humankind, and myself with her? What is going on in those secret places of my spirit with which you make so free? What is cooking, Mrs. Stuyvesant Oglander?\u201d Still Julia did not come, and the noise of twenty people in that tiny room, which was so large that no one hired it, was the noise of a multitude. Then I saw a curious thing. There was a little red-headed man whom no one seemed to know, a dowdy fellow quite unlike the general run of my wife\u2019s guests; he had been standing by the caviar for twenty minutes eating as fast as a rabbit. Now he wiped his mouth with his handkerchief and, on the impulse apparently, leaned forward and dabbed the beak of the swan, removing the drop of water that had been swelling there and would soon have fallen. Then he looked round furtively to see if he had been observed, caught my eye, and giggled nervously. \u201cBeen wanting to do that for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cBet you don\u2019t knowhow many drops to the minute. I do, I counted.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve no idea.\u201d \u201cGuess. Tanner if you\u2019re wrong; half a dollar if you\u2019re right. That\u2019s fair.\u201d \u201cThree,\u201d I said. \u201cCoo, you\u2019re a sharp one. Been counting \u2019em yourself.\u201d But he showed no inclination to pay this debt. Instead he said: \u201cHow d\u2019you figure this out. I\u2019m an Englishman born and bred, but this is my first time on the Atlantic.\u201d \u201cYou flew out perhaps?\u201d \u201cNo, nor over it.\u201d \u201cThen I presume you went round the world and came across the Pacific.\u201d \u201cYou are a sharp one and no mistake. I\u2019ve made quite a bit getting into arguments over that one.\u201d \u201cWhat was your route?\u201d I asked, wishing to be agreeable. \u201cAh, that\u2019d be telling. Well, I must skedaddle. So long.\u201d \u201cCharles,\u201d said my wife, \u201cthis is Mr. Kramm, of Interastral Films.\u201d \u201cSo you are Mr. Charles Ryder,\u201d said Mr. Kramm. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell, well, well,\u201d he paused. I waited. \u201cThe purser here says we\u2019re heading for dirty weather. What d\u2019you know about that?\u201d \u201cFar less than the purser.\u201d \u201cPardon me, Mr. Ryder, I don\u2019t quite get you.\u201d \u201cI mean I know less than the purser.\u201d \u201cIs that so? Well, well, well. I\u2019ve enjoyed our talk very much. I hope that it will be the first of many.\u201d An Englishwoman said: \u201cOh, that swan! Six weeks in America has given me an absolute phobia of ice. Do tell me, how did it feel meeting Celia again after two years? I know I should feel indecently bridal. But Celia\u2019s never quite got the orange blossom out of her hair, has she?\u201d Another woman said: \u201cIsn\u2019t it heaven saying good-bye and knowing we shall meet again in half an hour and go on meeting every half-hour for days?\u201d Our guests began to go, and each on leaving informed me of something my wife had promised to bring me to in the near future; it was the theme of the evening that we should all be seeing a lot of each other, that we had formed one of those molecular systems that physicists can illustrate. At last the swan was wheeled out, too, and I said to my wife, \u201cJulia never came.\u201d \u201cNo, she telephoned. I couldn\u2019t hear what she said, there was such a noise going on\u2014something about a dress. Quite lucky really, there wasn\u2019t room for a cat. It was a lovely party, wasn\u2019t it? Did you hate it very much? You behaved beautifully and looked so distinguished. Who was your red-haired chum?\u201d\u201cNo chum of mine.\u201d \u201cHow very peculiar! Did you say anything to Mr. Kramm about working in Hollywood?\u201d \u201cOf course not.\u201d \u201cOh, Charles, you are a worry to me. It\u2019s not enough just to stand about looking distinguished and a martyr for Art. Let\u2019s go to dinner. We\u2019re at the Captain\u2019s table. I don\u2019t suppose he\u2019ll dine down tonight, but it\u2019s polite to be fairly punctual.\u201d By the time that we reached the table the rest of the party had arranged themselves. On either side of the Captain\u2019s empty chair sat Julia and Mrs. Stuyvesant Oglander; besides them there was an English diplomat and his wife, Senator Stuyvesant Oglander, and an American clergyman at present totally isolated between two pairs of empty chairs. This clergyman later described himself\u2014redundantly it seemed\u2014as an Episcopalian Bishop. Husbands and wives sat together here. My wife was confronted with a quick decision, and although the steward attempted to direct us otherwise, sat so that she had the senator and I the Bishop. Julia gave us both a little dismal signal of sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m miserable about the party,\u201d she said, \u201cmy beastly maid totally disappeared with every dress I have. She only turned up half an hour ago. She\u2019d been playing ping-pong.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been telling the Senator what he missed,\u201d said Mrs. Stuyvesant Oglander. \u201cWherever Celia is, you\u2019ll find she knows all the significant people.\u201d \u201cOn my right,\u201d said the Bishop, \u201ca significant couple are expected. They take all their meals in their cabin except when they have been informed in advance that the Captain will be present.\u201d We were a gruesome circle; even my wife\u2019s high social spirit faltered. At moments I heard bits of her conversation. \u201c\u2026 an extraordinary little red-haired man. Captain Foulenough in person.\u201d \u201cBut I understood you to say, Lady Celia, that you were unacquainted with him.\u201d \u201cI meant he was like Captain Foulenough.\u201d \u201cI begin to comprehend. He impersonated this friend of yours in order to come to your party.\u201d \u201cNo, no. Captain Foulenough is simply a comic character.\u201d \u201cThere seems to have been nothing very amusing about this other man. Your friend is a comedian?\u201d \u201cNo, no. Captain Foulenough is an imaginary character in an English paper. You know, like your \u2018Popeye.\u2019 \u201dThe senator laid down knife and fork. \u201cTo recapitulate: an imposter came to your party and you admitted him because of a fancied resemblance to a fictitious character in a cartoon.\u201d \u201cYes, I suppose that was it really.\u201d The senator looked at his wife as much as to say: \u201cSignificant people, huh!\u201d I heard Julia across the table trying to trace, for the benefit of the diplomat, the marriage-connections of her Hungarian and Italian cousins. The diamonds flashed in her hair and on her fingers, but her hands were nervously rolling little balls of crumb, and her starry head drooped in despair. The Bishop told me of the goodwill mission on which he was traveling to Barcelona\u2026 \u201ca very, very valuable work of clearance has been performed, Mr. Ryder. The time has now come to rebuild on broader foundations. I have made it my aim to reconcile the so-called Anarchists and the so-called Communists, and with that in view I and my committee have digested all the available documentation of the subject. Our conclusion, Mr. Ryder, is unanimous. There is no fundamental diversity between the two ideologies. It is a matter of personalities, Mr. Ryder, and what personalities have put asunder personalities can unite\u2026\u201d On the other side I heard: \u201cAnd may I make so bold as to ask what institutions sponsored your husband\u2019s expedition?\u201d The diplomat\u2019s wife bravely engaged the Bishop across the gulf that separated them. \u201cAnd what language will you speak when you get to Barcelona?\u201d \u201cThe language of Reason and Brotherhood, madam,\u201d and, turning back to me, \u201cThe speech of the coming century is in thoughts not in words. Do you not agree, Mr. Ryder?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhat are words?\u201d said the Bishop. \u201cWhat indeed?\u201d \u201cMere conventional symbols, Mr. Ryder, and this is an age rightly skeptical of conventional symbols.\u201d My mind reeled; after the parrot-house fever of my wife\u2019s party, and unplumbed emotions of the afternoon, after all the exertions of my wife\u2019s pleasures in New York, after the months of solitude in the steaming, green shadows of the jungle, this was too much. I felt like Lear on the heath, like the Duchess of Malfi bayed by madmen. I summoned cataracts and hurricanoes, and as if by conjury the call was immediately answered. For some time now, though whether it was a mere trick of the nerves I did not then know, I had felt a recurrent and persistently growing motion\u2014aheave and shudder of the large dining-room as of the breast of a man in deep sleep. Now my wife turned to me and said: \u201cEither I am a little drunk or it\u2019s getting rough,\u201d and, even as she spoke we found ourselves leaning sideways in our chairs; there was a crash and tinkle of falling cutlery by the wall, and on our table the wine glasses all together toppled and rolled over, while each of us steadied the plates and forks and looked at the other with expressions that varied between frank horror in the diplomat\u2019s wife and relief in Julia. The gale which, unheard, unseen, unfelt, in our enclosed and insulated world had, for an hour, been mounting over us, had now veered and fallen full on our bows. Silence followed the crash, then a high, nervous babble of laughter. Stewards laid napkins on the pools of spilt wine. We tried to resume the conversation, but all were waiting, as the little ginger man had watched the drop swell and fall from the swan\u2019s beak, for the next great blow; it came, heavier than the last. \u201cThis is where I say good night to you all,\u201d said the diplomat\u2019s wife, rising. Her husband led her to their cabin. The dining-room was emptying fast. Soon only Julia, my wife, and I were left at the table, and, telepathically, Julia said, \u201cLike King Lear.\u201d \u201cOnly each of us is all three of them.\u201d \u201cWhat can you mean?\u201d asked my wife. \u201cLear, Kent, Fool.\u201d \u201cOh, dear, it\u2019s like that agonizing Foulenough conversation over again. Don\u2019t try and explain.\u201d \u201cI doubt if I could,\u201d I said. Another climb, another vast drop. The stewards were at work making things fast, shutting things up, hustling away unstable ornaments. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve finished dinner and set a fine example of British phlegm,\u201d said my wife. \u201cLet\u2019s go and see what\u2019s on.\u201d Once, on our way to the lounge, we had all three to cling to a pillar; when we got there we found it almost deserted; the band played but no one danced; the tables were set for tombola but no one bought a card, and the ship\u2019s officer, who made a speciality of calling the numbers with all the patter of the lower deck\u2014\u201csweet sixteen and never been kissed\u2014key of the door, twenty- one\u2014clickety-click, sixty-six\u201d\u2014was idly talking to his colleagues; there were a score of scattered novel readers, a few games of bridge, some brandy drinking in the smoking-room, but all our guests of two hours before had disappeared. The three of us sat for a little by the empty dance floor; my wife was fullof schemes by which, without impoliteness, we could move to another table in the dining-room. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to go to the restaurant,\u201d she said, \u201cand pay extra for exactly the same dinner. Only film people go there, anyway. I don\u2019t see why we should be made to.\u201d Presently she said: \u201cIt\u2019s making my head ache and I\u2019m tired, anyway. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d Julia went with her. I walked round the ship, on one of the covered decks where the wind howled and the spray leaped up from the darkness and smashed white and brown against the glass screen; men were posted to keep the passengers off the open decks. Then I, too, went below. In my dressing-room everything breakable had been stowed away, the door to the cabin was hooked open, and my wife called plaintively from within. \u201cI feel terrible. I didn\u2019t know a ship of this size could pitch like this,\u201d she said, and her eyes were full of consternation and resentment, like those of a woman who, at the end of her time, at length realizes that however luxurious the nursing home, and however well paid the doctor, her labor is inevitable; and the lift and fall of the ship came regularly as the pains of childbirth. I slept next door; or, rather, I lay there between dreaming and waking. In a narrow bunk, on a hard mattress, there might have been rest, but here the beds were broad and buoyant; I collected what cushions I could find and tried to wedge myself firm, but through the night I turned with each swing and twist of the ship\u2014she was rolling now as well as pitching\u2014and my head rang with the creak and thud. Once, an hour before dawn, my wife appeared like a ghost in the doorway, supporting herself with either hand on the jambs, saying: \u201cAre you awake? Can\u2019t you do something? Can\u2019t you get something from the doctor?\u201d I rang for the night steward, who had a draught ready prepared, which comforted her a little. And all night between dreaming and waking I thought of Julia; in my brief dreams she took a hundred fantastic and terrible and obscene forms, but in my waking thoughts she returned with her sad, starry head just as I had seen her at dinner. After first light I slept for an hour or two, then awoke clear-headed, with a joyous sense of anticipation. The wind had dropped a little, the steward told me, but was still blowing hard and there was a very heavy swell; \u201cwhich there\u2019s nothing worse than aheavy swell,\u201d he said, \u201cfor the enjoyment of the passengers. There\u2019s not many breakfasts wanted this morning.\u201d I looked in at my wife, found her sleeping, and closed the door between us; then I ate salmon kedgeree and cold Bradenham ham and telephoned for a barber to come and shave me. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff in the sitting-room for the lady,\u201d said the steward; \u201cshall I leave it for the time?\u201d I went to see. There was a second delivery of cellophane parcels from the shops on board, some ordered by radio from friends in New York whose secretaries had failed to remind them of our departure in time, some by our guests as they left the cocktail party. It was no day for flower vases; I told him to leave them on the floor and then, struck by the thought, removed the card from Mr. Kramm\u2019s roses and sent them with my love to Julia. She telephoned while I was being shaved. \u201cWhat a deplorable thing to do, Charles! How unlike you!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you like them?\u201d \u201cWhat can I do with roses on a day like this?\u201d \u201cSmell them.\u201d There was a pause and a rustle of unpacking. \u201cThey\u2019ve absolutely no smell at all.\u201d \u201cWhat have you had for breakfast?\u201d \u201cMuscat grapes and cantaloupe.\u201d \u201cWhen shall I see you?\u201d \u201cBefore lunch. I\u2019m busy till then with a masseuse.\u201d \u201cA masseuse?\u201d \u201cYes, isn\u2019t it peculiar? I\u2019ve never had one before, except once when I hurt my shoulder hunting. What is it about being on a boat that makes everyone behave like a film star?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cHow about these very embarrassing roses?\u201d The barber did his work with extraordinary dexterity\u2014indeed, with agility, for he stood like a swordsman in a ballet sometimes on the point of one foot, sometimes on the other, lightly flicking the lather off his blade, and swooping back to my chin as the ship righted herself; I should not have dared use a safety razor on myself. The telephone rang again. It was my wife. \u201cHow are you, Charles?\u201d \u201cTired.\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t you coming to see me?\u201d\u201cI came once. I\u2019ll be in again.\u201d I brought her the flowers from the sitting-room; they completed the atmosphere of a maternity ward which she had managed to create in the cabin; the stewardess had the air of a midwife, standing by the bed, a pillar of starched linen and composure. My wife turned her head on the pillow and smiled wanly; she stretched out a bare arm and caressed with the tips of her fingers the cellophane and silk ribbons of the largest bouquet. \u201cHow sweet people are,\u201d she said faintly, as though the gale were a private misfortune of her own for which the world in its love was condoling with her. \u201cI take it you\u2019re not getting up.\u201d \u201cOh no, Mrs. Clark is being so sweet\u201d; she was always quick to get servants\u2019 names. \u201cDon\u2019t bother. Come in sometimes and tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d \u201cNow, now, dear,\u201d said the stewardess, \u201cthe less we are disturbed today the better.\u201d My wife seemed to make a sacred, female rite even of seasickness. Julia\u2019s cabin, I knew, was somewhere below ours. I waited for her by the lift on the main deck; when she came we walked once round the promenade; I held the rail; she took my other arm. It was hard going; through the streaming glass we saw a distorted world of gray sky and black water. When the ship rolled heavily I swung her round so that she could hold the rail with her other hand; the howl of the wind was subdued, but the whole ship creaked with strain. We made the circuit once, then Julia said: \u201cIt\u2019s no good. That woman beat hell out of me, and I feel limp, anyway. Let\u2019s sit down.\u201d The great bronze doors of the lounge had torn away from their hooks and were swinging free with the roll of the ship; regularly and, it seemed, irresistibly, first one, then the other, opened and shut; they paused at the completion of each half circle, began to move slowly and finished fast with a resounding clash. There was no real risk in passing them, except of slipping and being caught by that swift, final blow; there was ample time to walk through unhurried but there was something forbidding in the sight of that great weight of uncontrolled metal, flapping to and fro, which might have made a timid man flinch or skip through too quickly; I rejoiced to feel Julia\u2019s hand perfectly steady on my arm and know, as I walked beside her, that she was wholly undismayed. \u201cBravo,\u201d said a man sitting nearby. \u201cI confess I went round the other way. I didn\u2019t like the look of those doors somehow. They\u2019ve been trying to fix them all the morning.\u201d There were few people about that day, and that few seemed bound together by a camaraderie of reciprocal esteem; they did nothing except sit ratherglumly in their armchairs, drink occasionally, and exchange congratulations on not being seasick. \u201cYou\u2019re the first lady I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said the man. \u201cI\u2019m very lucky.\u201d \u201c We are very lucky,\u201d he said, with a movement which began as a bow and ended as a lurch forward to his knees, as the blotting-paper floor dipped steeply between us. The roll carried us away from him, clinging together but still on our feet, and we quickly sat where our dance led us, on the further side, in isolation; a web of life-lines had been stretched across the lounge, and we seemed like boxers, roped into the ring. The steward approached. \u201cYour usual, sir? Whisky and tepid water, I think. And for the lady? Might I suggest a nip of champagne?\u201d \u201cD\u2019you know, the awful thing is I would like champagne very much,\u201d said Julia. \u201cWhat a life of pleasure\u2014roses, half an hour with a female pugilist, and now champagne!\u201d \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t go on about the roses. It wasn\u2019t my idea in the first place. Someone sent them to Celia.\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s quite different. It lets you out completely. But it makes my massage worse.\u201d \u201cI was shaved in bed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad about the roses,\u201d said Julia. \u201cFrankly, they were a shock. They made me think we were starting the day on the wrong foot.\u201d I knew what she meant, and in that moment felt as though I had shaken off some of the dust and grit of ten dry years; then and always, however she spoke to me, in half sentences, single words, stock phrases of contemporary jargon, in scarcely perceptible movements of eyes or lips or hands, however inexpressible her thought, however quick and far it had glanced from the matter in hand, however deep it had plunged, as it often did, straight from the surface to the depths, I knew; even that day when I still stood on the extreme verge of love, I knew what she meant. We drank our wine and soon our new friend came lurching towards us down the life-line. \u201cMind if I join you? Nothing like a bit of rough weather for bringing people together. This is my tenth crossing, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. I can see you are an experienced sailor, young lady.\u201d \u201cNo. As a matter of fact, I\u2019ve never been at sea before except coming to New York and, of course, crossing the Channel. I don\u2019t feel sick, thank God, but I feel tired. I thought at first it was only the massage, but I\u2019m coming to the conclusion it\u2019s the ship.\u201d \u201cMy wife\u2019s in a terrible way. She\u2019s an experienced sailor. Only shows,doesn\u2019t it?\u201d He joined us at luncheon, and I did not mind his being there; he had clearly taken a fancy to Julia, and he thought we were man and wife; this misconception and his gallantry seemed in some way to bring her and me closer together. \u201cSaw you two last night at the Captain\u2019s table,\u201d he said, \u201cwith all the nobs.\u201d \u201cVery dull nobs.\u201d \u201cIf you ask me, nobs always are. When you get a storm like this you find out what people are really made of.\u201d \u201cYou have a predilection for good sailors?\u201d \u201cWell, put like that I don\u2019t know that I do\u2014what I mean is, it makes for getting together.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cTake us for example. But for this we might never have met. I\u2019ve had some very romantic encounters at sea in my time. If the lady will excuse me, I\u2019d like to tell you about a little adventure I had in the Gulf of Lions when I was younger than I am now.\u201d We were both weary; lack of sleep, the incessant din, and the strain every movement required, wore us down. We spent that afternoon apart in our cabins. I slept and when I awoke the sea was as high as ever, inky clouds swept over us, and the glass streamed still with water, but I had grown used to the storm in my sleep, had made its rhythm mine, had become part of it, so that I arose strongly and confidently and found Julia already up and in the same temper. \u201cWhat d\u2019you think?\u201d she said. \u201cThat man\u2019s giving a little \u2018get-together party\u2019 tonight in the smoking-room for all the good sailors. He asked me to bring my husband.\u201d \u201cAre we going?\u201d \u201cOf course\u2026 I wonder if I ought to feel like the lady our friend met on the way to Barcelona. I don\u2019t, Charles, not a bit.\u201d There were eighteen people at the \u201cget-together party\u201d; we had nothing in common except immunity from seasickness. We drank champagne, and presently our host said: \u201cTell you what, I\u2019ve got a roulette wheel. Trouble is we can\u2019t go to my cabin on account of the wife, and we aren\u2019t allowed to play in public.\u201d So the party adjourned to my sitting-room and we played for low stakes until late into the night, when Julia left and our host had drunk too much wine to be surprised that she and I were not in the same quarters. When all but he had gone, he fell asleep in his chair, and I left him there. It was the last I saw of him, for later\u2014so the steward told me when he came from returning theroulette things to the man\u2019s cabin\u2014he broke his thigh, falling in the corridor, and was taken to the ship\u2019s hospital. All next day Julia and I spent together without interruption; talking, scarcely moving, held in our chairs by the swell of the sea. After luncheon the last hardy passengers went to rest and we were alone as though the place had been cleared for us, as though tact on a titanic scale had sent everyone tip- toeing out to leave us to one another. The bronze doors of the lounge had been fixed, but not before two seamen had been badly injured. They had tried various devices, lashing with ropes and, later, when these failed, with steel hawsers, but there was nothing to which they could be made fast; finally, they drove wooden wedges under them, catching them in the brief moment of repose when they were full open, and these held firm. When, before dinner, she went to her cabin to get ready (no one dressed that night) and I came with her, uninvited, unopposed, expected, and behind closed doors took her in my arms and first kissed her, there was no alteration from the mood of the afternoon. Later, turning it over in my mind, as I turned in my bed with the rise and fall of the ship, through the long, lonely, drowsy night, I recalled the courtships of the past, dead, ten years; how, knotting my tie before setting out, putting the gardenia in my buttonhole, I would plan my evening and think at such and such a time, at such and such an opportunity, I shall cross the start-line and open my attack for better or worse; \u201cthis phase of the battle has gone on long enough,\u201d I would think; \u201ca decision must be reached.\u201d With Julia there were no phases, no start-line, no tactics at all. But later that night when she went to bed and I followed her to her door, she stopped me. \u201cNo, Charles, not yet. Perhaps never. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if I want love.\u201d Then something, some surviving ghost from those dead ten years\u2014for one cannot die, even for a little, without some loss\u2014made me say, \u201cLove? I\u2019m not asking for love.\u201d \u201cOh yes, Charles, you are,\u201d she said, and putting up her hand gently stroked my cheek; then shut her door. And I reeled back, first on one wall, then on the other, of the long, softly lighted, empty corridor; for the storm, it appeared, had the form of a ring; all day we had been sailing through its still center; now we were once more in the full fury of the wind\u2014and that night was to be rougher than the one before. Ten hours of talking: what had we to say? Plain fact mostly, the record of our two lives, so long widely separate, now being knit to one. Through all that storm-tossed night I rehearsed what she had told me; she was no longer the alternate succubus and starry vision of the night before; she had given all that was transferable of her past into my keeping. She told me, as I have already retold, of her courtship and marriage; she told me, as though fondly turning the pages of an old nursery-book, of her childhood, and I lived long, sunny days with her in the meadows, with Nanny Hawkins on her camp stool and Cordelia asleep in the pram, slept quiet nights under the dome with the religious pictures fading round the cot as the nightlight burned low and the embers settled in the grate. She told me of her life with Rex and of the secret, vicious, disastrous escapade that had taken her to New York. She, too, had had her dead years. She told me of her long struggle with Rex as to whether she should have a child; at first she wanted one, but learned after a year that an operation was needed to make it possible; by that time Rex and she were out of love, but he still wanted his child, and when at last she consented, it was born dead. \u201cRex has never been unkind to me intentionally,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that he isn\u2019t a real person at all; he\u2019s just a few faculties of a man highly developed; the rest simply isn\u2019t there. He couldn\u2019t imagine why it hurt me to find two months after we came back to London from our honeymoon, that he was still keeping up with Brenda Champion.\u201d \u201cI was glad when I found Celia was unfaithful,\u201d I said. \u201cI felt it was all right for me to dislike her.\u201d \u201cIs she? Do you? I\u2019m glad. I don\u2019t like her either. Why did you marry her?\u201d \u201cPhysical attraction. Ambition. Everyone agrees she\u2019s the ideal wife for a painter. Loneliness, missing Sebastian.\u201d \u201cYou loved him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cOh yes. He was the forerunner.\u201d Julia understood. The ship creaked and shuddered, rose and fell. My wife called to me from the next room: \u201cCharles, are you there?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been asleep such a long while. What time is it?\u201d \u201cHalf past three.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no better, is it?\u201d \u201cWorse.\u201d \u201cI feel a little better, though. D\u2019you think they\u2019d bring me some tea or something if I rang the bell?\u201dI got her some tea and biscuits from the night steward. \u201cDid you have an amusing evening?\u201d \u201cEveryone\u2019s seasick.\u201d \u201cPoor Charles. It was going to have been such a lovely trip, too. It may be better tomorrow.\u201d I turned out the light and shut the door between us. Waking and dreaming, through the strain and creak and heave of the long night, firm on my back with my arms and legs spread wide to check the roll, and my eyes open to the darkness, I lay thinking of Julia. \u201c\u2026 We thought papa might come back to England after mummy died, or that he might marry again, but he lives just as he did. Rex and I often go to see him now. I\u2019ve grown fond of him\u2026. Sebastian\u2019s disappeared completely\u2026. Cordelia\u2019s in Spain with an ambulance\u2026. Bridey leads his own extraordinary life. He wanted to shut Brideshead after mummy died, but papa wouldn\u2019t have it for some reason, so Rex and I live there now, and Bridey has two rooms up in the dome, next to Nanny Hawkins, part of the old nurseries. He\u2019s like a character from Chekhov. One meets him sometimes coming out of the library or on the stairs\u2014I never know when he\u2019s at home\u2014and now and then he suddenly comes in to dinner like a ghost quite unexpectedly. \u201c\u2026 Oh, Rex\u2019s parties! Politics and money. They can\u2019t do anything except for money; if they walk round the lake they have to make bets about how many swans they see\u2026 sitting up till two, amusing Rex\u2019s girls, hearing them gossip, rattling away endlessly on the backgammon board while the men play cards and smoke cigars. The cigar smoke. I can smell it in my hair when I wake up in the morning; it\u2019s in my clothes when I dress at night. Do I smell of it now? D\u2019you think that woman who rubbed me, felt it in my skin? \u201c\u2026 At first I used to stay away with Rex in his friends\u2019 houses. He doesn\u2019t make me anymore. He was ashamed of me when he found I didn\u2019t cut the kind of figure he wanted, ashamed of himself for having been taken in. I wasn\u2019t at all the article he\u2019d bargained for. He can\u2019t see the point of me, but whenever he\u2019s made up his mind there isn\u2019t a point and he\u2019s begun to feel comfortable, he gets a surprise\u2014some man, or even woman, he respects, takes a fancy to me and he suddenly sees that there is a whole world of things we understand and he doesn\u2019t\u2026 he was upset when I went away. He\u2019ll be delighted to have me back. I was faithful to him until this last thing came along. There\u2019s nothing like a good upbringing. Do you know last year, when I thought I was going to have a child, I\u2019d decided to have it brought up a Catholic? I hadn\u2019t thought about religion before; I haven\u2019t since; but just at that time, when I was waiting for the birth, I thought, \u2018That\u2019s one thing I can give her. It doesn\u2019t seem to have done me much good, but my child shall haveit.\u2019 It was odd, wanting to give something one had lost oneself. Then, in the end, I couldn\u2019t even give that: I couldn\u2019t even give her life. I never saw her; I was too ill to know what was going on, and afterwards, for a long time, until now, I didn\u2019t want to speak about her\u2014she was a daughter, so Rex didn\u2019t so much mind her being dead. \u201cI\u2019ve been punished a little for marrying Rex. You see, I can\u2019t get all that sort of thing out of my mind, quite\u2014Death, Judgment, Heaven, Hell, Nanny Hawkins, and the catechism. It becomes part of oneself, if they give it one early enough. And yet I wanted my child to have it\u2026 now I suppose I shall be punished for what I\u2019ve just done. Perhaps that is why you and I are here together like this\u2026 part of a plan.\u201d That was almost the last thing she said to me\u2014\u201cpart of a plan\u201d\u2014before we went below and I left her at the cabin door. Next day the wind had again dropped, and again we were wallowing in the swell. The talk was less of seasickness now than of broken bones; people had been thrown about in the night, and there had been many nasty accidents on bathroom floors. That day, because we had talked so much the day before and because what we had to say needed few words, we spoke little. We had books; Julia found a game she liked. When after long silences we spoke, our thoughts, we found, had kept pace together side by side. Once I said, \u201cYou are standing guard over your sadness.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all I have earned. You said yesterday. My wages.\u201d \u201cAn I.O.U. from life. A promise to pay on demand.\u201d Rain ceased at midday; at evening the clouds dispersed and the sun, astern of us, suddenly broke into the lounge where we sat, putting all the lights to shame. \u201cSunset,\u201d said Julia, \u201cthe end of our day.\u201d She rose and, though the roll and pitch of the ship seemed unabated, led me up to the boat-deck. She put her arm through mine and her hand into mine, in my great-coat pocket. The deck was dry and empty, swept only by the wind of the ship\u2019s speed. As we made our halting, laborious way forward, away from the flying smuts of the smoke stack, we were alternately jostled together, then strained, nearly sundered, arms and fingers interlocked as I held the rail and Julia clung to me, thrust together again, drawn apart; then, in a plunge deeper than the rest, I found myself flung across her, pressing her against the rail, warding myself off her with the arms that held her prisoner on either side,and as the ship paused at the end of its drop as though gathering strength for the ascent, we stood thus embraced, in the open, cheek against cheek, her hair blowing across my eyes; the dark horizon of tumbling water, flashing now with gold, stood still above us, then came sweeping down till I was staring through Julia\u2019s dark hair into a wide and golden sky, and she was thrown forward on my heart, held up by my hands on the rail, her face still pressed to mine. In that minute, with her lips to my ear and her breath warm in the salt wind, Julia said, though I had not spoken, \u201cYes, now,\u201d and as the ship righted herself and for the moment ran into calmer waters, Julia led me below. It was no time for the sweets of luxury; they would come, in their season, with the swallow and the lime flowers. Now on the rough water there was a formality to be observed, no more. It was as though a deed of conveyance of her narrow loins had been drawn and sealed. I was making my first entry as the freeholder of a property I would enjoy and develop at leisure. We dined that night high up in the ship, in the restaurant, and saw through the bow windows the stars come out and sweep across the sky as once, I remembered, I had seen them sweep above the towers and gables of Oxford. The stewards promised that tomorrow night the band would play again and the place be full. We had better book now, they said, if we wanted a good table. \u201cOh dear,\u201d said Julia, \u201cwhere can we hide in fair weather, we orphans of the storm?\u201d I could not leave her that night, but early next morning, as once again I made my way back along the corridor, I found I could walk without difficulty; the ship rode easily on a smooth sea, and I knew that our solitude was broken. My wife called joyously from her cabin: \u201cCharles, Charles, I feel so well. What do you think I am having for breakfast?\u201d I went to see. She was eating a beef steak. \u201cI\u2019ve fixed up for a visit to the hairdresser\u2014do you know they couldn\u2019t take me till four o\u2019clock this afternoon, they\u2019re so busy suddenly? So I shan\u2019t appear till the evening, but lots of people are coming in to see us this morning, and I\u2019ve asked Miles and Janet to lunch with us in our sitting-room. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve been a worthless wife to you the last two days. What have you been up to?\u201d \u201cOne gay evening,\u201d I said, \u201cwe played roulette till two o\u2019clock, next door in the sitting-room, and our host passed out.\u201d\u201cGoodness. It sounds very disreputable. Have you been behaving, Charles? You haven\u2019t been picking up sirens?\u201d \u201cThere was scarcely a woman about. I spent most of the time with Julia.\u201d \u201cOh, good. I always wanted to bring you together. She\u2019s one of my friends I knew you\u2019d like. I expect you were a godsend to her. She\u2019s had rather a gloomy time lately. I don\u2019t expect she mentioned it, but\u2026\u201d my wife proceeded to relate a current version of Julia\u2019s journey to New York. \u201cI\u2019ll ask her to cocktails this morning,\u201d she concluded. Julia came among the others, and it was happiness enough, now merely to be near her. \u201cI hear you\u2019ve been looking after my husband for me,\u201d my wife said. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve become very matey. He and I and a man whose name we don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cMr. Kramm, what have you done to your arm?\u201d \u201cIt was the bathroom floor,\u201d said Mr. Kramm, and explained at length how he had fallen. That night the Captain dined at his table and the circle was complete, for claimants came to the chairs on the Bishop\u2019s right, two Japanese who expressed deep interest in his projects for world-brotherhood. The Captain was full of chaff at Julia\u2019s endurance in the storm, offering to engage her as a seaman; years of sea-going had given him jokes for every occasion. My wife, fresh from the beauty parlor, was unmarked by her three days of distress, and in the eyes of many seemed to outshine Julia, whose sadness had gone and been replaced by an incommunicable content and tranquility; incommunicable save to me; she and I, separated by the crowd, sat alone together close enwrapped, as we had lain in each other\u2019s arms the night before. There was a gala spirit in the ship that night. Though it meant rising at dawn to pack, everyone was determined that for this one night he would enjoy the luxury the storm had denied him. There was no solitude. Every corner of the ship was thronged; dance music and high, excited chatter, stewards darting everywhere with trays of glasses, the voice of the officer in charge of tombola\u2014\u201cKelly\u2019s eye\u2014number one; legs, eleven; and we\u2019ll Shake the Bag\u201d\u2014Mrs. Stuyvesant Oglander in a paper cap, Mr. Kramm and his bandages, the two Japanese decorously throwing paper streamers and hissing like geese. I did not speak to Julia, alone, all that evening. We met for a minute next day on the starboard side of the ship while everyone else crowded to port to see the officials come aboard and to gaze at the green coastline of Devon.\u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d \u201cLondon for a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cCelia\u2019s going straight home. She wants to see the children.\u201d \u201cYou, too?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cIn London then.\u201d \u201cCharles, the little red-haired man\u2014Foulenough. Did you see? Two plain clothes police have taken him off.\u201d \u201cI missed it. There was such a crowd on that side of the ship.\u201d \u201cI found out the trains and sent a telegram. We shall be home by dinner. The children will be asleep. Perhaps we might wake Johnjohn up, just for once.\u201d \u201cYou go down,\u201d I said. \u201cI shall have to stay in London.\u201d \u201cOh, but Charles, you must come. You haven\u2019t seen Caroline.\u201d \u201cWill she change much in a week or two?\u201d \u201cDarling, she changes every day.\u201d \u201cThen what\u2019s the point of seeing her now? I\u2019m sorry, my dear, but I must get the pictures unpacked and see how they\u2019ve traveled. I must fix up for the exhibition right away.\u201d \u201cMust you?\u201d she said, but I knew that her resistance ended when I appealed to the mysteries of my trade. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing. Besides, I don\u2019t know if Andrew and Cynthia will be out of the flat. They took it till the end of the month.\u201d \u201cI can go to a hotel.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s so grim. I can\u2019t bear you to be alone your first night home. I\u2019ll stay and go down tomorrow.\u201d \u201cYou mustn\u2019t disappoint the children.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Her children, my art, the two mysteries of our trades. \u201cWill you come for the week-end?\u201d \u201cIf I can.\u201d \u201cAll British passports to the smoking-room, please,\u201d said a steward. \u201cI\u2019ve arranged with that sweet Foreign Office man at our table to get us off early with him,\u201d said my wife.Two I t was my wife\u2019s idea to hold the private view on Friday. \u201cWe are out to catch the critics this time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s high time they began to take you seriously, and they know it. This is their chance. If you open on Monday, they\u2019ll most of them have just come up from the country, and they\u2019ll dash off a few paragraphs before dinner\u2014I\u2019m only worrying about the weeklies of course. If we give them the week-end to think about it, we shall have them in an urbane Sunday-in-the-country mood. They\u2019ll settle down after a good luncheon, tuck up their cuffs, and turn out a nice, leisurely full-length essay, which they\u2019ll reprint later in a nice little book. Nothing less will do this time.\u201d She was up and down from the Old Rectory several times during the month of preparation, revising the list of invitations and helping with the hanging. On the morning of the private view I telephoned to Julia and said: \u201cI\u2019m sick of the pictures already and never want to see them again, but I suppose I shall have to put in an appearance.\u201d \u201cD\u2019you want me to come?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d much rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cCelia sent a card with \u201cBring everyone\u201d written across it in green ink. When do we meet?\u201d \u201cIn the train. You might pick up my luggage.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019ll have it packed soon I\u2019ll pick you up, too, and drop you at the gallery. I\u2019ve got a fitting next door at twelve.\u201d When I reached the gallery my wife was standing looking through the window to the street. Behind her half a dozen unknown picture-lovers were moving from canvas to canvas, catalogue in hand; they were people who had once bought a wood-cut and were consequently on the gallery\u2019s list of patrons. \u201cNo one has come yet,\u201d said my wife. \u201cI\u2019ve been here since ten and it\u2019s been very dull. Whose car was that you came in?\u201d \u201cJulia\u2019s.\u201d \u201cJulia\u2019s? Why didn\u2019t you bring her in? Oddly enough, I\u2019ve just",

      "chapter_text": "on the painful occasion of the removal of his master\u2019s luggage when it was decided not to return from the war; then Plender had been valet, as, officially, he still was, but he had in the past years introduced a kind of suffragan, a Swiss body-servant, to attend to the wardrobe and also, when occasion arose, lend a hand with less dignified tasks about the house, and had in effect become major-domo of that fluctuating and mobile household; sometimes he even referred to himself on the telephone as \u201cthe secretary.\u201d There was an acre of thin ice between him and Wilcox. Fortunately the two men took a liking to one another, and the thing was solved in a series of three-cornered discussions with Cordelia. Plender and Wilcox became joint grooms of the chambers, like \u201cBlues\u201d and Life Guards with equal precedence, Plender having as his particular province his Lordship\u2019s own apartments and Wilcox a sphere of influence in the public rooms; the senior footman was given a black coat and promoted butler, the nondescript Swiss, on arrival, was to have plain clothes and full valet\u2019s status; there was a general increase in wages to meet the new dignities, and all were content. Julia and I, who had left Brideshead a month before, thinking we should not return, moved back for the reception. When the day came, Cordelia went to the station and we remained to greet him at home. It was a bleak and gusty day. Cottages and lodges were decorated; plans for a bonfire that night and forthe village silver band to play on the terrace, were put down, but the house flag, that had not flown for twenty-five years, was hoisted over the pediment, and flapped sharply against the leaden sky. Whatever harsh voices might be bawling into the microphones of central Europe, and whatever lathes spinning in the armament factories, the return of Lord Marchmain was a matter of first importance in his own neighborhood. He was due at three o\u2019clock. Julia and I waited in the drawing-room until Wilcox, who had arranged with the stationmaster to be kept informed, announced \u201cthe train is signaled,\u201d and a minute later, \u201cthe train is in; his Lordship is on the way.\u201d Then we went to the front portico and waited there with the upper servants. Soon the Rolls appeared at the turn in the drive, followed at some distance by the two vans. It drew up; first Cordelia got out, then Cara; there was a pause, a rug was handed to the chauffeur, a stick to the footman; then a leg was cautiously thrust forward. Plender was by now at the car door; another servant\u2014the Swiss valet\u2014had emerged from a van; together they lifted Lord Marchmain out and set him on his feet; he felt for his stick, grasped it, and stood for a minute collecting his strength for the few low steps which led to the front door. Julia gave a little sigh of surprise and touched my hand. We had seen him nine months ago at Monte Carlo, when he had been an upright and stately figure, little changed from when I first met him in Venice. Now he was an old man. Plender had told us his master had been unwell lately: he had not prepared us for this. Lord Marchmain stood bowed and shrunken, weighed down by his great- coat, a white muffler fluttering untidily at his throat, a cloth cap pulled low on his forehead, his face white and lined, his nose colored by the cold; the tears which gathered in his eyes came not from emotion but from the east wind; he breathed heavily. Cara tucked in the end of his muffler and whispered something to him. He raised a gloved hand\u2014a schoolboy\u2019s glove of gray wool\u2014and made a small, weary gesture of greeting to the group at the door; then, very slowly, with his eyes on the ground before him, he made his way into the house. They took off his coat and cap and muffler and the kind of leather jerkin which he wore under them; thus stripped he seemed more than ever wasted but more elegant; he had cast the shabbiness of extreme fatigue. Cara straightened his tie; he wiped his eyes with a bandanna handkerchief and shuffled with his stick to the hall fire. There was a little heraldic chair by the chimney-piece, one of a set which stood against the walls, a little, inhospitable, flat-seated thing, a mere excuse for the elaborate armorial painting on its back, on which, perhaps, no one, noteven a weary footman, had ever sat since it was made; there Lord Marchmain sat and wiped his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s the cold,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten how cold it is in England. Quite bowled me over.\u201d \u201cCan I get you anything, my lord?\u201d \u201cNothing, thank you. Cara, where are those confounded pills?\u201d \u201cAlex, the doctor said not more than three times a day.\u201d \u201cDamn the doctor. I feel quite bowled over.\u201d Cara produced a blue bottle from her bag and Lord Marchmain took a pill. Whatever was in it, seemed to revive him. He remained seated, his long legs stuck out before him, his cane between them, his chin on its ivory handle, but he began to take notice of us all, to greet us and to give orders. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not at all the thing today; the journey\u2019s taken it out of me. Ought to have waited a night at Dover. Wilcox, what rooms have you prepared for me?\u201d \u201cYour old ones, my Lord.\u201d \u201cWon\u2019t do; not till I\u2019m fit again. Too many stairs; must be on the ground floor. Plender, get a bed made up for me downstairs.\u201d Plender and Wilcox exchanged an anxious glance. \u201cVery good, my Lord. Which room shall we put it in?\u201d Lord Marchmain thought for a moment. \u201cThe Chinese drawing-room; and, Wilcox, the \u2018Queen\u2019s bed.\u2019 \u201d \u201cThe Chinese drawing-room, my lord, the \u2018Queen\u2019s bed\u2019?\u201d \u201cYes, yes. I may be spending some time there in the next few weeks.\u201d The Chinese drawing-room was one I had never seen used; in fact one could not normally go further into it than a small roped area round the door, where sight-seers were corralled on the days the house was open to the public; it was a splendid, uninhabitable museum of Chippendale carving and porcelain and lacquer and painted hangings; the Queen\u2019s bed, too, was an exhibition piece, a vast velvet tent like the baldachino at St. Peter\u2019s. Had Lord Marchmain planned this lying-in-state for himself, I wondered, before he left the sunshine of Italy? Had he thought of it during the scudding rain of his long, fretful journey? Had it come to him at that moment, an awakened memory of childhood, a dream in the nursery\u2014\u201cWhen I\u2019m grown up I\u2019ll sleep in the Queen\u2019s bed in the Chinese drawing-room\u201d\u2014the apotheosis of adult grandeur? Few things, certainly, could have caused more stir in the house. What had been foreseen as a day of formality became one of fierce exertion; housemaids began making a fire, removing covers, unfolding linen; men in aprons, never normally seen, shifted furniture; the estate carpenters werecollected to dismantle the bed. It came down the main staircase in pieces, at intervals during the afternoon; huge sections of Rococo, velvet-covered cornice; the twisted, gilt and velvet columns which formed its posts; beams of unpolished wood, made not to be seen, which performed invisible, structural functions below the draperies; plumes of dyed feathers, which sprang from gold-mounted ostrich eggs and crowned the canopy; finally, the mattresses with four toiling men to each. Lord Marchmain seemed to derive comfort from the consequences of his whim; he sat by the fire watching the bustle, while we stood in a half circle\u2014Cara, Cordelia, Julia, and I\u2014and talked to him. Color came back to his cheeks and light to his eyes. \u201cBrideshead and his wife dined with me in Rome,\u201d he said. \u201cSince we are all members of the family\u201d\u2014and his eye moved ironically from Cara to me\u2014\u201cI can speak without reserve. I found her deplorable. Her former consort, I understand, was a seafaring man and, presumably, the less exacting, but how my son, at the ripe age of thirty-eight, with, unless things have changed very much, a very free choice among the women of England, can have settled on\u2014I suppose I must call her so\u2014 Beryl \u2026\u201d He left the sentence eloquently unfinished. Lord Marchmain showed no inclination to move, so presently we drew up chairs\u2014the little, heraldic chairs, for everything else in the hall was ponderous\u2014and sat round him. \u201cI daresay I shall not be really fit again until summer comes,\u201d he said. \u201cI look to you four to amuse me.\u201d There seemed little we could do at the moment to lighten the rather somber mood; he, indeed, was the most cheerful of us. \u201cTell me,\u201d he said, \u201cthe circumstances of Brideshead\u2019s courtship.\u201d We told him what we knew. \u201cMatch-boxes,\u201d he said. \u201cMatch-boxes. I think she\u2019s past child-bearing.\u201d Tea was brought us at the hall fireplace. \u201cIn Italy,\u201d he said, \u201cno one believes there will be a war. They think it will all be \u2018arranged.\u2019 I suppose, Julia, you no longer have access to political information? Cara, here, is fortunately a British subject by marriage. It is not a thing she customarily mentions, but it may prove valuable. She is legally Mrs. Hicks, are you not, my dear? We know little of Hicks, but we shall be grateful to him, none the less, if it comes to war. And you,\u201d he said, turning the attack to me, \u201cyou will no doubt become an official artist?\u201d \u201cNo. As a matter of fact I am negotiating now for a commission in the Special Reserve.\u201d \u201cOh, but you should be an artist. I had one with my squadron during the last war, for weeks\u2014until we went up to the line.\u201dThis waspishness was new. I had always been aware of a frame of malevolence under his urbanity; now it protruded like his own sharp bones through the sunken skin. It was dark before the bed was finished; we went to see it, Lord Marchmain stepping quite briskly now through the intervening rooms. \u201cI congratulate you. It really looks remarkably well. Wilcox, I seem to remember a silver basin and ewer\u2014they stood in a room we called \u2018the Cardinal\u2019s dressing-room,\u2019 I think\u2014suppose we had them here on the console. Then if you will send Plender and Gaston to me, the luggage can wait till tomorrow\u2014simply the dressing case and what I need for the night. Plender will know. If you will leave me with Plender and Gaston, I will go to bed. We will meet later; you will dine here and keep me amused.\u201d We turned to go; as I was at the door he called me back. \u201cIt looks very well, does it not?\u201d \u201cVery well.\u201d \u201cYou might paint it, eh\u2014and call it the Death Bed ?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Cara, \u201che has come home to die.\u201d \u201cBut when he first arrived he was talking so confidently of recovery.\u201d \u201cThat was because he was so ill. When he is himself, he knows he is dying and accepts it. His sickness is up and down; one day, sometimes for several days on end, he is strong and lively and then he is ready for death, then he is down and afraid. I do not know how it will be when he is more and more down. That must come in good time. The doctors in Rome gave him less than a year. There is someone coming from London, I think tomorrow, who will tell us more.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cHis heart; some long word at the heart. He is dying of a long word.\u201d That evening Lord Marchmain was in good spirits; the room had a Hogarthian aspect, with the dinner-table set for the four of us by the grotesque, chinoiserie chimney-piece, and the old man propped among his pillows, sipping champagne, tasting, praising, and failing to eat, the succession of dishes which had been prepared for his homecoming. Wilcox had brought out for the occasion the gold plate, which I had not before seen in use; that, the gilt mirrors, and the lacquer and the drapery of the great bed and Julia\u2019s mandarin coat gave the scene an air of pantomime, of Aladdin\u2019s cave. Just at the end, when the time came for us to go, his spirits flagged. \u201cI shall not sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cWho is going to sit with me? Cara, carissima,you are fatigued. Cordelia, will you watch for an hour in this Gethsemane?\u201d Next morning I asked her how the night had passed. \u201cHe went to sleep almost at once. I came in to see him at two to make up the fire; the lights were on, but he was asleep again. He must have woken up and turned them on; he had to get out of bed to do that. I think perhaps he is afraid of the dark.\u201d It was natural, with her hospital experience, that Cordelia should take charge of her father. When the doctors came that day they gave their instructions to her, instinctively. \u201cUntil he gets worse,\u201d she said, \u201cI and the valet can look after him. We don\u2019t want nurses in the house before they are needed.\u201d At this stage the doctors had nothing to recommend except to keep him comfortable and administer certain drugs when his attacks came on. \u201cHow long will it be?\u201d \u201cLady Cordelia, there are men walking about in hearty old age whom their doctors gave a week to live. I have learned one thing in medicine; never prophesy.\u201d These two men had made a long journey to tell her this; the local doctor was there to accept the same advice in technical phrases. That night Lord Marchmain reverted to the topic of his new daughter-in- law; it had never been long out of his mind, finding expression in various sly hints throughout the day; now he lay back in his pillows and talked of her at length. \u201cI have never been much moved by family piety until now,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I am frankly appalled at the prospect of\u2014of Beryl taking what was once my mother\u2019s place in this house. Why should that uncouth pair sit here childless while the place crumbles about their ears? I will not disguise from you that I have taken a dislike to Beryl. \u201cPerhaps it was unfortunate that we met in Rome. Anywhere else might have been more sympathetic. And yet, if one comes to consider it, where could I have met her without repugnance? We dined at Ranieri\u2019s; it is a quiet little restaurant I have frequented for years\u2014no doubt you know it. Beryl seemed to fill the place. I, of course, was host, though to hear Beryl press my son with food, you might have thought otherwise. Brideshead was always a greedy boy; a wife who has his best interests at heart should seek to restrain him. However, that is a matter of small importance. \u201cShe had no doubt heard of me as a man of irregular life. I can only describe her manner to me as roguish. A naughty old man, that\u2019s what she thought I was. I suppose she had met naughty old admirals and knew how they should be humored\u2026. I could not attempt to reproduce her conversation.I will give you one example. \u201cThey had been to an audience at the Vatican that morning; a blessing for their marriage\u2014I did not follow attentively\u2014something of the kind had happened before, I gathered, some previous husband, some previous Pope. She described, rather vivaciously, how on this earlier occasion she had gone with a whole body of newly married couples, mostly Italians of all ranks, some of the simpler girls in their wedding dresses, and how each had appraised the other, the bridegrooms looking the brides over, comparing their own with one another\u2019s, and so forth. Then she said, \u2018This time, of course, we were in private, but do you know, Lord Marchmain, I felt as though it was I who was leading in the bride.\u2019 \u201cIt was said with great indelicacy. I have not yet quite fathomed her meaning. Was she making a play on my son\u2019s name, or was she, do you think, referring to his undoubted virginity? I fancy the latter. Anyway, it was with pleasantries of that kind that we passed the evening. \u201cI don\u2019t think she would be quite in her proper element here, do you? Who shall I leave it to? The entail ended with me, you know. Sebastian, alas, is out of the question. Who wants it? Quis ? Would you like it, Cara? No, of course you would not. Cordelia? I think I shall leave it to Julia and Charles.\u201d \u201cOf course not, papa, it\u2019s Bridey\u2019s.\u201d \u201cAnd\u2026 Beryl\u2019s? I will have Gregson down one day soon and go over the matter. It is time I brought my will up to date; it is full of anomalies and anachronisms\u2026. I have rather a fancy for the idea of installing Julia here; so beautiful this evening, my dear; so beautiful always; much, much more suitable.\u201d Shortly after this he sent to London for his solicitor, but, on the day he came, Lord Marchmain was suffering from an attack and would not see him. \u201cPlenty of time,\u201d he said, between painful gasps for breath, \u201canother day, when I am stronger,\u201d but the choice of his heir was constantly in his mind, and he referred often to the time when Julia and I should be married and in possession. \u201cDo you think he really means to leave it to us?\u201d I asked Julia. \u201cYes, I think he does.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s monstrous for Bridey.\u201d \u201cIs it? I don\u2019t think he cares much for the place. I do, you know. He and Beryl would be much more content in some little house somewhere.\u201d \u201cYou mean to accept it?\u201d \u201cCertainly. It\u2019s papa\u2019s to leave as he likes. I think you and I could be very happy here.\u201d It opened a prospect; the prospect one gained at the turn of the avenue, as Ihad first seen it with Sebastian, of the secluded valley, the lakes falling away one below the other, the old house in the foreground, the rest of the world abandoned and forgotten; a world of its own of peace and love and beauty; a soldier\u2019s dream in a foreign bivouac; such a prospect perhaps as a high pinnacle of the temple afforded after the hungry days in the desert and the jackal-haunted nights. Need I reproach myself if sometimes I was taken by the vision? The weeks of illness wore on and the life of the house kept pace with the faltering strength of the sick man. There were days when Lord Marchmain was dressed, when he stood at the window or moved on his valet\u2019s arm from fire to fire through the rooms of the ground floor, when visitors came and went\u2014neighbors and people from the estate, men of business from London\u2014 parcels of new books were opened and discussed, a piano was moved into the Chinese drawing-room; once at the end of February, on a single, unexpected day of brilliant sunshine, he called for a car and got as far as the hall, had on his fur coat, and reached the front door. Then suddenly he lost interest in the drive, said \u2018Not now. Later. One day in the summer,\u201d took his man\u2019s arm again and was led back to his chair. Once he had the humor of changing his room and gave detailed orders for a move to the Painted Parlor; the chinoiserie, he said, disturbed his rest\u2014he kept the lights full on at night\u2014 but again lost heart, countermanded everything, and kept his room. On other days the house was hushed as he sat high in bed, propped by his pillows, with laboring breath; even then he wanted to have us round him; night or day he could not bear to be alone; when he could not speak his eyes followed us, and if anyone left the room he would look distressed, and Cara, sitting often for hours at a time by his side against the pillows with an arm in his, would say, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Alex, she\u2019s coming back.\u201d Brideshead and his wife returned from their honeymoon and stayed a few nights; it was one of the bad times, and Lord Marchmain refused to have them near him. It was Beryl\u2019s first visit, and she would have been unnatural if she had shown no curiosity about what had nearly been, and now again promised soon to be, her home. Beryl was natural enough, and surveyed the place fairly thoroughly in the days she was there. In the strange disorder caused by Lord Marchmain\u2019s illness, it must have seemed capable of much improvement; she referred once or twice to the way in which establishments of similar size had been managed at various Government Houses she had visited. Brideshead took her visiting among the tenants by day, and in the evenings, she talked to me of painting, or to Cordelia of hospitals, or to Julia of clothes, with cheerful assurance. The shadow of betrayal, the knowledge of how precarious were their just expectations, was all one-sided. I was not easy with them; but thatwas no new thing to Brideshead; in the little circle of shyness in which he was used to move, my guilt passed unseen. Eventually it became clear that Lord Marchmain did not intend to see more of them. Brideshead was admitted alone for a minute\u2019s leave-taking; then they left. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do here,\u201d said Brideshead, \u201cand it\u2019s very distressing for Beryl. We\u2019ll come back if things get worse.\u201d The bad spells became longer and more frequent; a nurse was engaged. \u201cI never saw such a room,\u201d she said, \u201cnothing like it anywhere; no conveniences of any sort.\u201d She tried to have her patient moved upstairs, where there was running water, a dressing-room for herself, a \u201csensible\u201d narrow bed she could \u201cget round\u201d\u2014what she was used to\u2014but Lord Marchmain would not budge. Soon, as days and nights became indistinguishable to him, a second nurse was installed; the specialists came again from London; they recommended a new and rather daring treatment, but his body seemed weary of all drugs and did not respond. Presently there were no good spells, merely brief fluctuations in the speed of his decline. Brideshead was called. It was the Easter holidays and Beryl was busy with her children. He came alone, and having stood silently for some minutes beside his father, who sat silently looking at him, he left the room and, joining the rest of us, who were in the library, said, \u201cPapa must see a priest.\u201d It was not the first time the topic had come up. In the early days, when Lord Marchmain first arrived, the parish priest\u2014since the chapel was shut there was a new church and presbytery in Melstead\u2014had come to call as a matter of politeness. Cordelia had put him off with apologies and excuses, but when he was gone she said: \u201cNot yet. Papa doesn\u2019t want him yet.\u201d Julia, Cara, and I were there at the time; we each had something to say, began to speak, and thought better of it. It was never mentioned between the four of us, but Julia, alone with me, said, \u201cCharles, I see great Church trouble ahead.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t they even let him die in peace?\u201d \u201cThey mean something so different by \u2018peace.\u2019 \u201d \u201cIt would be an outrage. No one could have made it clearer, all his life, what he thought of religion. They\u2019ll come now, when his mind\u2019s wandering and he hasn\u2019t the strength to resist, and claim him as a death-bed penitent. I\u2019ve had a certain respect for their Church up till now. If they do a thing like that I shall know that everything stupid people say about them is quite true\u2014 that it\u2019s all superstition and trickery.\u201d Julia said nothing. \u201cDon\u2019t you agree?\u201d Still Julia said nothing. \u201cDon\u2019t you agree?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Charles. I simply don\u2019t know.\u201dAnd, though none of us spoke of it, I felt the question ever present, growing through all the weeks of Lord Marchmain\u2019s illness; I saw it when Cordelia drove off early in the mornings to mass; I saw it as Cara took to going with her; this little cloud, the size of a man\u2019s hand, that was going to swell into a storm among us. Now Brideshead, in his heavy, ruthless way, planted the problem down before us. \u201cOh, Bridey, do you think he would?\u201d asked Cordelia. \u201cI shall see that he does,\u201d said Brideshead. \u201cI shall take Father Mackay in to him tomorrow.\u201d Still the clouds gathered and did not break; none of us spoke. Cara and Cordelia went back to the sickroom; Brideshead looked for a book, found one, and left us. \u201cJulia,\u201d I said, \u201chow can we stop this tomfoolery?\u201d She did not answer for some time; then: \u201cWhy should we?\u201d \u201cYou know as well as I do. It\u2019s just\u2014just an unseemly incident.\u201d \u201cWho am I to object to unseemly incidents?\u201d she asked sadly. \u201cAnyway, what harm can it do? Let\u2019s ask the doctor.\u201d We asked the doctor, who said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. It might alarm him of course; on the other hand, I have known cases where it has had a wonderfully soothing effect on a patient; I\u2019ve even known it act as a positive stimulant. It certainly is usually a great comfort to the relations. Really I think it\u2019s a thing for Lord Brideshead to decide. Mind you, there is no need for immediate anxiety. Lord Marchmain is very weak today; tomorrow he may be quite strong again. Is it not usual to wait a little?\u201d \u201cWell, he wasn\u2019t much help,\u201d I said to Julia, when we left him. \u201cHelp? I really can\u2019t quite see why you\u2019ve taken it so much to heart that my father shall not have the last sacraments.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s such a lot of witchcraft and hypocrisy.\u201d \u201cIs it? Anyway, it\u2019s been going on for nearly two thousand years. I don\u2019t know why you should suddenly get in a rage now.\u201d Her voice rose; she was swift to anger of late months. \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, write to The Times; get up and make a speech in Hyde Park; start a \u2018No Popery\u2019 riot, but don\u2019t bore me about it. What\u2019s it got to do with you or me whether my father sees his parish priest?\u201d I knew these fierce moods of Julia\u2019s, such as had overtaken her at the fountain in moonlight, and dimly surmised their origin; I knew they could not be assuaged by words. Nor could I have spoken, for the answer to her question was still unformed; the sense that the fate of more souls than one was at issue; that the snow was beginning to shift on the high slopes.Brideshead and I breakfasted together next morning with the night-nurse, who had just come off duty. \u201cHe\u2019s much brighter today,\u201d she said. \u201cHe slept very nicely for nearly three hours. When Gaston came to shave him he was quite chatty.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said Brideshead. \u201cCordelia went to mass. She\u2019s driving Father Mackay back here to breakfast.\u201d I had met Father Mackay several times; he was a stocky, middle-aged, genial Glasgow-Irishman who, when we met, was apt to ask me such questions as, \u201cWould you say now, Mr. Ryder, that the painter Titian was more truly artistic than the painter Raphael?\u201d and, more disconcertingly still, to remember my answers: \u201cTo revert, Mr. Ryder, to what you said when last I had the pleasure to meet you, would it be right now to say that the painter Titian\u2026\u201d usually ending with some such reflection as: \u201cAh, it\u2019s a grand resource for a man to have the talent you have, Mr. Ryder, and the time to indulge it.\u201d Cordelia could imitate him. This morning he made a hearty breakfast, glanced at the headlines of the paper, and then said with professional briskness: \u201cAnd now, Lord Brideshead, would the poor soul be ready to see me, do you think?\u201d Brideshead led him out; Cordelia followed, and I was left alone among the breakfast things. In less than a minute I heard the voices of all three outside the door. \u201c\u2026 can only apologize.\u201d \u201c\u2026 poor soul. Mark you, it was seeing a strange face; depend upon it, it was that\u2014an unexpected stranger. I well understand it.\u201d \u201c\u2026 Father, I am sorry\u2026 bringing you all this way\u2026\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t think about it at all, Lady Cordelia. Why, I\u2019ve had bottles thrown at me in the Gorbals\u2026. Give him time. I\u2019ve known worse cases make beautiful deaths. Pray for him\u2026. I\u2019ll come again\u2026 and now if you\u2019ll excuse me I\u2019ll just pay a little visit to Mrs. Hawkins. Yes, indeed, I know the way well.\u201d Then Cordelia and Brideshead came into the room. \u201cI gather the visit was not a success.\u201d \u201cIt was not. Cordelia, will you drive Father Mackay home when he comes down from nanny? I\u2019m going to telephone to Beryl and see when she needs me home.\u201d \u201cBridey, it was horrible. What are we to do?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can at the moment.\u201d He left the room. Cordelia\u2019s face was grave; she took a piece of bacon from the dish, dipped it in mustard and ate it. \u201cDamn Bridey,\u201d she said, \u201cI knew it wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cWould you like to know? We walked in there in a line; Cara was reading the paper aloud to papa. Bridey said, \u201cI\u2019ve brought Father Mackay to see you\u201d; papa said, \u201cFather Mackay, I am afraid you have been brought here under a misapprehension. I am not in extremis, and I have not been a practicing member of your Church for twenty-five years. Brideshead, show Father Mackay the way out.\u201d Then we all turned about and walked away, and I heard Cara start reading the paper again, and that, Charles, was that.\u201d I carried the news to Julia, who lay with her bed-table amid a litter of newspapers and envelopes. \u201cMumbo-jumbo is off,\u201d I said. \u201cThe witch-doctor has gone.\u201d \u201cPoor papa.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s great sucks to Bridey.\u201d I felt triumphant. I had been right, everyone else had been wrong, truth had prevailed; the threat that I had felt hanging over Julia and me ever since that evening at the fountain, had been averted, perhaps dispelled for ever; and there was also\u2014I can now confess it\u2014another unexpressed, inexpressible, indecent little victory that I was furtively celebrating. I guessed that that morning\u2019s business had put Brideshead some considerable way further from his rightful inheritance. In that I was correct; a man was sent for from the solicitors in London; in a day or two he came and it was known throughout the house that Lord Marchmain had made a new will. But I was wrong in thinking that the religious controversy was quashed; it flamed up again after dinner on Brideshead\u2019s last evening. \u201c\u2026 What papa said was, \u2018I am not in extremis, I have not been a practicing member of the Church for twenty-five years.\u2019 \u201d \u201cNot \u2018 the Church,\u2019 \u2018your Church.\u2019 \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see the difference.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s every difference.\u201d \u201cBridey, it\u2019s quite plain what he meant.\u201d \u201cI presume he meant what he said. He meant that he had not been accustomed regularly to receive the sacraments, and since he was not at the moment dying, he did not mean to change his ways\u2014 yet.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s simply a quibble.\u201d \u201cWhy do people always think that one is quibbling when one tries to be precise? His plain meaning was that he did not want to see a priest that day, but that he would when he was \u2018 in extremis. \u2019 \u201d \u201cI wish someone would explain to me,\u201d I said, \u201cquite what the significance of these sacraments is. Do you mean that if he dies alone he goes to hell, andthat if a priest puts oil on him\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s not the oil,\u201d said Cordelia, \u201cthat\u2019s to heal him.\u201d \u201cOdder still\u2014well, whatever it is the priest does\u2014that he then goes to heaven. Is that what you believe?\u201d Cara then interposed: \u201cI think my nurse told me, someone did anyway, that if the priest got there before the body was cold it was all right. That\u2019s so, isn\u2019t it?\u201d The others turned on her. \u201cNo, Cara, it\u2019s not.\u201d \u201cOf course not.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got it all wrong, Cara.\u201d \u201cWell, I remember when Alphonse de Grenet died, Madame de Grenet had a priest hidden outside the door\u2014he couldn\u2019t bear the sight of a priest\u2014and brought him in before the body was cold; she told me herself, and they had a full Requiem for him, and I went to it.\u201d \u201cHaving a Requiem doesn\u2019t mean you go to heaven necessarily.\u201d \u201cMadame de Grenet thought it did.\u201d \u201cWell, she was wrong.\u201d \u201cDo any of you Catholics know what good you think this priest can do?\u201d I asked. \u201cDo you simply want to arrange it so that your father can have Christian burial? Do you want to keep him out of hell? I only want to be told.\u201d Brideshead told me at some length, and when he had finished Cara slightly marred the unity of the Catholic front by saying in simple wonder, \u201cI never heard that before.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s get this clear,\u201d I said; \u201che has to make an act of will; he has to be contrite and wish to be reconciled; is that right? But only God knows whether he has really made an act of will; the priest can\u2019t tell; and if there isn\u2019t a priest there, and he makes the act of will alone, that\u2019s as good as if there were a priest. And it\u2019s quite possible that the will may still be working when a man is too weak to make any outward sign of it; is that right? He may be lying, as though for dead, and willing all the time, and being reconciled, and God understands that; is that right?\u201d \u201cMore or less,\u201d said Brideshead. \u201cWell, for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d I said, \u201cwhat is the priest for?\u201d There was a pause in which Julia sighed and Brideshead drew breath as though to start further subdividing the propositions. In the silence Cara said, \u201cAll I know is that I shall take very good care to have a priest.\u201d \u201cBless you,\u201d said Cordelia, \u201cI believe that\u2019s the best answer.\u201d And we let the argument drop, each for different reasons, thinking it hadbeen inconclusive. Later Julia said: \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t start these religious arguments.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t start it.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t convince anyone else and you don\u2019t really convince yourself.\u201d \u201cI only want to know what these people believe. They say it\u2019s all based on logic.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019d let Bridey finish, he would have made it all quite logical.\u201d \u201cThere were four of you,\u201d I said. \u201cCara didn\u2019t know the first thing it was about, and may or may not have believed it; you knew a bit and didn\u2019t believe a word; Cordelia knew about as much and believed it madly; only poor Bridey knew and believed, and I thought he made a pretty poor show when it came to explaining. And people go round saying, \u2018At least Catholics know what they believe.\u2019 We had a fair cross-section tonight\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, Charles, don\u2019t rant. I shall begin to think you\u2019re getting doubts yourself.\u201d The weeks passed and still Lord Marchmain lived on. In June my divorce was made absolute and my former wife married for the second time. Julia would be free in September. The nearer our marriage got, the more wistfully, I noticed, Julia spoke of it; war was growing nearer, too\u2014we neither of us doubted that\u2014but Julia\u2019s tender, remote, it sometimes seemed, desperate longing did not come from any uncertainty outside herself; it suddenly darkened, too, into brief accesses of hate when she seemed to throw herself against the restraints of her love for me like a caged animal against the bars. I was summoned to the War Office, interviewed, and put on a list in case of emergency; Cordelia also, on another list; lists were becoming part of our lives once more, as they had been at school. Everything was being got ready for the coming \u201cEmergency.\u201d No one in that dark office spoke the word \u201cwar\u201d; it was taboo; we should be called for if there was \u201can emergency\u201d\u2014 not in case of strife, an act of human will; nothing so clear and simple as wrath or retribution; an emergency; something coming out of the waters, a monster with sightless face and thrashing tail thrown up from the depths. Lord Marchmain took little interest in events outside his own room; we took him the papers daily and made the attempt to read to him, but he turned his head on the pillows and with his eyes followed the intricate patterns about him. \u201cShall I go on?\u201d \u201cPlease do if it\u2019s not boring you.\u201d But he was not listening; occasionally at a familiar name he would whisper: \u201cIrwin\u2026 I knew him\u2014a mediocre fellow\u201d; occasionally some remote comment: \u201cCzechsmake good coachmen; nothing else\u201d; but his mind was far from world affairs; it was there, on the spot, turned in on himself; he had no strength for any other war than his own solitary struggle to keep alive. I said to the doctor, who was with us daily: \u201cHe\u2019s got a wonderful will to live, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cWould you put it like that? I should say a great fear of death.\u201d \u201cIs there a difference?\u201d \u201cOh dear, yes. He doesn\u2019t derive any strength from his fear, you know. It\u2019s wearing him out.\u201d Next to death, perhaps because they are like death, he feared darkness and loneliness. He liked to have us in his room and the lights burnt all night among the gilt figures; he did not wish us to speak much, but he talked himself, so quietly that we often could not hear him; he talked, I think, because his was the only voice he could trust, when it assured him that he was still alive; what he said was not for us, nor for any ears but his own. \u201cBetter today. Better today. I can see now, in the corner of the fireplace, where the mandarin is holding his gold bell and the crooked tree is in flower below his feet, where yesterday I was confused and took the little tower for another man. Soon I shall see the bridge and the three storks and know where the path leads over the hill. \u201cBetter tomorrow. We live long in our family and marry late. Seventy- three is no great age. Aunt Julia, my father\u2019s aunt, lived to be eighty-eight, born and died here, never married, saw the fire on beacon hill for the battle of Trafalgar, always called it \u2018the New House\u2019; that was the name they had for it in the nursery and in the fields when unlettered men had long memories. You can see where the old house stood near the village church; they call the field \u2018Castle Hill,\u2019 Horlick\u2019s field where the ground\u2019s uneven and half of it is waste, nettle, and brier in hollows too deep for plowing. They dug to the foundations to carry the stone for the new house; the house that was a century old when Aunt Julia was born. Those were our roots in the waste hollows of Castle Hill, in the brier and nettle; among the tombs in the old church and the chantry where no clerk sings. \u201cAunt Julia knew the tombs, cross-legged knight and doubleted earl, marquis like a Roman senator, limestone, alabaster, and Italian marble; tapped the escutcheons with her ebony cane, made the casque ring over old Sir Roger. We were knights then, barons since Agincourt, the larger honors came with the Georges. They came the last and they\u2019ll go the first; the barony goes on. When all of you are dead Julia\u2019s son will be called by the name his fathers bore before the fat days; the days of wool shearing and the wide corn lands, the days of growth and building, when the marshes were drained and thewaste land brought under the plow, when one built the house, his son added the dome, his son spread the wings and dammed the river. Aunt Julia watched them build the fountain; it was old before it came here, weathered two hundred years by the suns of Naples, brought by man-o\u2019-war in the days of Nelson. Soon the fountain will be dry till the rain fills it, setting the fallen leaves afloat in the basin; and over the lakes the reeds will spread and close. Better today. \u201cBetter today. I have lived carefully, sheltered myself from the cold winds, eaten moderately of what was in season, drunk fine claret, slept in my own sheets; I shall live long. I was fifty when they dismounted us and sent us into the line; old men stay at the base, the orders said, but Walter Venables, my commanding officer, my nearest neighbor, said: \u201cYou\u2019re as fit as the youngest of them, Alex.\u201d So I was; so I am now, if I could only breathe. \u201cNo air; no wind stirring under the velvet canopy. When the summer comes,\u201d said Lord Marchmain, oblivious of the deep corn and swelling fruit and the surfeited bees who slowly sought their hives in the heavy afternoon sunlight outside his windows, \u201cwhen the summer comes, I shall leave my bed and sit in the open air and breathe more easily. \u201cWho would have thought that all these little gold men, gentlemen in their own country, could live so long without breathing? Like toads in the coal, down a deep mine, untroubled. God take it, why have they dug a hole for me? Must a man stifle to death in his own cellars? Plender, Gaston, open the windows.\u201d \u201cThe windows are all wide open, my lord.\u201d A cylinder of oxygen was placed beside his bed, with a long tube, a face- piece, and a little stop-cock he could work himself. Often he said: \u201cIt\u2019s empty; look nurse, there\u2019s nothing comes out.\u201d \u201cNo, Lord Marchmain, it\u2019s quite full; the bubble here in the glass bulb shows that; it\u2019s at full pressure; listen, don\u2019t you hear it hiss? Try and breathe slowly, Lord Marchmain; quite gently, then you get the benefit.\u201d \u201cFree as air; that\u2019s what they say\u2014\u2018free as air.\u2019 Now they bring me my air in an iron barrel.\u201d Once he said: \u201cCordelia, what became of the chapel?\u201d \u201cThey locked it up, papa, when mummy died.\u201d \u201cIt was hers, I gave it to her. We\u2019ve always been builders in our family. I built it for her; in the shade of the pavilion; rebuilt with the old stones behind the old walls; it was the last of the new house to come, the first to go. There used to be a chaplain until the war. Do you remember him?\u201d \u201cI was too young.\u201d \u201cThen I went away\u2014left her in the chapel praying. It was hers. It was theplace for her. I never came back to disturb her prayers. They said we were fighting for freedom; I had my own victory. Was it a crime?\u201d \u201cI think it was, papa.\u201d \u201cCrying to heaven for vengeance? Is that why they\u2019ve locked me in this cave, do you think, with a black tube of air and the little yellow men along the walls, who live without breathing? Do you think that, child? But the wind will come soon, tomorrow perhaps, and we\u2019ll breathe again. The ill wind that will blow me good. Better tomorrow.\u201d Thus, till mid-July, Lord Marchmain lay dying, wearing himself down in the struggle to live. Then, since there was no reason to expect an immediate change, Cordelia went to London to see her women\u2019s organization about the coming \u201cemergency.\u201d That day Lord Marchmain became suddenly worse. He lay silent and quite still, breathing laboriously; only his open eyes, which sometimes moved about the room, gave any sign of consciousness. \u201cIs this the end?\u201d Julia asked. \u201cIt is impossible to say,\u201d the doctor answered; \u201cwhen he does die it will probably be like this. He may recover from the present attack. The only thing is not to disturb him. The least shock will be fatal.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going for Father Mackay,\u201d she said. I was not surprised. I had seen it in her mind all the summer. When she had gone I said to the doctor, \u201cWe must stop this nonsense.\u201d He said: \u201cMy business is with the body. It\u2019s not my business to argue whether people are better alive or dead, or what happens to them after death. I only try to keep them alive.\u201d \u201cAnd you said just now any shock would kill him. What could be worse for a man who fears death, as he does, than to have a priest brought to him\u2014a priest he turned out when he had the strength?\u201d \u201cI think it may kill him.\u201d \u201cThen will you forbid it?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve no authority to forbid anything. I can only give my opinion.\u201d \u201cCara, what do you think?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want him made unhappy. That is all there is to hope for now; that he\u2019ll die without knowing it. But I should like the priest there, all the same.\u201d \u201cWill you try and persuade Julia to keep him away\u2014until the end? After that he can do no harm.\u201d \u201cI will ask her to leave Alex happy, yes.\u201d In half an hour Julia was back with Father Mackay. We all met in the library. \u201cI\u2019ve telegraphed for Bridey and Cordelia,\u201d I said. \u201cI hope you agree that nothing must be done",

      "chapter_text": "till they arrive.\u201d\u201cI wish they were here,\u201d said Julia. \u201cYou can\u2019t take the responsibility alone,\u201d I said; \u201ceveryone else is against you. Doctor Grant, tell her what you said to me just now.\u201d \u201cI said that the shock of seeing a priest might well kill him; without that he may survive this attack. As his medical man I must protest against anything being done to disturb him.\u201d \u201cCara?\u201d \u201cJulia, dear, I know you are thinking for the best, but, you know, Alex was not a religious man. He scoffed always. We mustn\u2019t take advantage of him, now he\u2019s weak, to comfort our own consciences. If Father Mackay comes to him when he is unconscious, then he can be buried in the proper way, can he not, Father?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll go and see how he is,\u201d said the doctor, leaving us. \u201cFather Mackay,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know how Lord Marchmain greeted you last time you came; do you think it possible he can have changed now?\u201d \u201cThank God, by his grace it is possible.\u201d \u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Cara, \u201cyou could slip in while he is sleeping, say the words of absolution over him; he would never know.\u201d \u201cI have seen so many men and women die,\u201d said the priest; \u201cI never knew them sorry to have me there at the end.\u201d \u201cBut they were Catholics; Lord Marchmain has never been one except in name\u2014at any rate, not for years. He was a scoffer, Cara said so.\u201d \u201cChrist came to call, not the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\u201d The doctor returned. \u201cThere\u2019s no change,\u201d he said. \u201cNow doctor,\u201d said the priest, \u201chow would I be a shock to anyone?\u201d He turned his bland, innocent, matter-of-fact face first on the doctor, then upon the rest of us. \u201cDo you know what I want to do? It is something so small, no show about it. I don\u2019t wear special clothes, you know. I go just as I am. He knows the look of me now. There\u2019s nothing alarming. I just want to ask him if he is sorry for his sins. I want him to make some little sign of assent; I want him, anyway, not to refuse me; then I want to give him God\u2019s pardon. Then, though that\u2019s not essential, I want to anoint him. It is nothing, a touch of the fingers, just some oil from this little box, look, it is nothing to hurt him.\u201d \u201cOh, Julia,\u201d said Cara, \u201cwhat are we to say? Let me speak to him.\u201d She went to the Chinese drawing-room; we waited in silence; there was a wall of fire between Julia and me. Presently Cara returned. \u201cI don\u2019t think he heard,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I knew how to put it to him. I said: \u2018Alex, you remember the priest from Melstead. You were very naughty when he came to see you. You hurt his feelings very much. Now he\u2019s here again. I want you to see him just for my sake, to make friends.\u2019 But he didn\u2019tanswer. If he\u2019s unconscious, it couldn\u2019t make him unhappy to see the priest, could it, doctor?\u201d Julia, who had been standing still and silent, suddenly moved. \u201cThank you for your advice, doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cI take full responsibility for whatever happens. Father Mackay, will you please come and see my father now,\u201d and without looking at me, led him to the door. We all followed. Lord Marchmain was lying as I had seen him that morning, but his eyes were now shut; his hands lay, palm upwards, above the bed-clothes; the nurse had her fingers on the pulse of one of them. \u201cCome in,\u201d she said brightly, \u201cyou won\u2019t disturb him now.\u201d \u201cD\u2019you mean\u2026 ?\u201d \u201cNo, no, but he\u2019s past noticing anything.\u201d She held the oxygen apparatus to his face and the hiss of escaping gas was the only sound at the bedside. The priest bent over Lord Marchmain and blessed him. Julia and Cara knelt at the foot of the bed. The doctor, the nurse, and I stood behind them. \u201cNow,\u201d said the priest, \u201cI know you are sorry for all the sins of your life, aren\u2019t you? Make a sign, if you can. You\u2019re sorry, aren\u2019t you?\u201d But there was no sign. \u201cTry and remember your sins; tell God you are sorry. I am going to give you absolution. While I am giving it, tell God you are sorry you have offended him.\u201d He began to speak in Latin. I recognized the words \u201cego te absolvo in nomine Patris\u2026\u201d and saw the priest make the sign of the cross. Then I knelt, too, and prayed: \u201cO God, if there is a God, forgive him his sins, if there is such a thing as sin,\u201d and the man on the bed opened his eyes and gave a sigh, the sort of sigh I had imagined people made at the moment of death, but his eyes moved so that we knew there was still life in him. I suddenly felt the longing for a sign, if only of courtesy, if only for the sake of the woman I loved, who knelt in front of me, praying, I knew, for a sign. It seemed so small a thing that was asked, the bare acknowledgment of a present, a nod in the crowd. I prayed more simply; \u201cGod forgive him his sins\u201d and \u201cPlease God, make him accept your forgiveness.\u201d So small a thing to ask. The priest took the little silver box from his pocket and spoke again in Latin, touching the dying man with an oily wad; he finished what he had to do, put away the box and gave the final blessing. Suddenly Lord Marchmain moved his hand to his forehead; I thought he had felt the touch of the chrism and was wiping it away. \u201cO God,\u201d I prayed, \u201cdon\u2019t let him do that.\u201d But there was no need for fear; the hand moved slowly down his breast, then to his shoulder, and Lord Marchmain made the sign of the cross. Then I knew that the sign I had asked for was not a little thing, not a passing nod ofrecognition, and a phrase came back to me from my childhood of the veil of the temple being rent from top to bottom. It was over; we stood up; the nurse went back to the oxygen cylinder; the doctor bent over his patient. Julia whispered to me: \u201cWill you see Father Mackay out? I\u2019m staying here for a little.\u201d Outside the door Father Mackay became the simple, genial man I had known before. \u201cWell, now, and that was a beautiful thing to see. I\u2019ve known it happen that way again and again. The devil resists to the last moment and then the Grace of God is too much for him. You\u2019re not a Catholic I think, Mr. Ryder, but at least you\u2019ll be glad for the ladies to have the comfort of it.\u201d As we were waiting for the chauffeur, it occurred to me that Father Mackay should be paid for his services. I asked him awkwardly. \u201cWhy, don\u2019t think about it, Mr. Ryder. It was a pleasure,\u201d he said, \u201cbut anything you care to give is useful in a parish like mine.\u201d I found I had three pounds in my note- case and gave them to him. \u201cWhy, indeed, that\u2019s more than generous. God bless you, Mr. Ryder. I\u2019ll call again, but I don\u2019t think the poor soul has long for this world.\u201d Julia remained in the Chinese drawing-room until, at five o\u2019clock that evening, her father died, proving both sides right in the dispute, priest and doctor. Thus I come to the broken sentences which were the last words spoken between Julia and me, the last memories. When her father died Julia remained some minutes with his body; the nurse came to the next room to announce the news and I had a glimpse of her through the open door, kneeling at the foot of the bed, and of Cara sitting by her. Presently the two women came out together, and Julia said to me: \u201cNot now; I\u2019m just taking Cara up to her room; later.\u201d While she was still upstairs Brideshead and Cordelia arrived from London; when at last we met alone it was by stealth, like young lovers. Julia said: \u201cHere in the shadow, in the corner of the stair\u2014a minute to say good-bye.\u201d \u201cSo long to say so little.\u201d \u201cYou knew?\u201d \u201cSince this morning; since before this morning; all this year.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know till today. Oh, my dear, if you could only understand. Then I could bear to part, or bear it better. I should say my heart was breaking, if I believed in broken hearts. I can\u2019t marry you, Charles; I can\u2019t be with you everagain.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cHow can you know?\u201d \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d \u201cJust go on\u2014alone. How can I tell what I shall do? You know the whole of me. You know I\u2019m not one for a life of mourning. I\u2019ve always been bad. Probably I shall be bad again, punished again. But the worse I am, the more I need God. I can\u2019t shut myself out from his mercy. That is what it would mean; starting a life with you, without him. One can only hope to see one step ahead. But I saw today there was one thing unforgivable\u2014like things in the schoolroom, so bad they were unpunishable, that only mummy could deal with\u2014the bad thing I was on the point of doing, that I\u2019m not quite bad enough to do; to set up a rival good to God\u2019s. Why should I be allowed to understand that, and not you, Charles? It may be because of mummy, nanny, Cordelia, Sebastian\u2014perhaps Bridey and Mrs. Muspratt\u2014keeping my name in their prayers; or it may be a private bargain between me and God, that if I give up this one thing I want so much, however bad I am, he won\u2019t quite despair of me in the end. \u201cNow we shall both be alone, and I shall have no way of making you understand.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to make it easier for you,\u201d I said; \u201cI hope your heart may break; but I do understand.\u201d The avalanche was down, the hillside swept bare behind it; the last echoes died on the white slopes; the new mound glittered and lay still in the silent valley.Epilogue Brideshead Revisited T he worst place we\u2019ve struck yet,\u201d said the commanding officer; \u201cno facilities, no amenities, and Brigade sitting right on top of us. There\u2019s one pub in Flyte St. Mary with capacity for about twenty\u2014that, of course, will be out of bounds for officers; there\u2019s a Naafi in the camp area. I hope to run transport once a week to Melstead Carbury. Marchmain is ten miles away and damn-all when you get there. It will therefore be the first concern of company officers to organize recreation for their men. M.O., I want you to take a look at the lakes to see if they\u2019re fit for bathing.\u201d Very good, sir.\u201d \u201cBrigade expects us to clean up the house for them. I should have thought some of those half-shaven scrimshankers I see lounging round Headquarters might have saved us the trouble; however\u2026. Ryder, you will find a fatigue party of fifty and report to the Quartering Commandant at the house at 1045 hours; he\u2019ll show you what we\u2019re taking over.\u201d \u201cVery good, sir.\u201d \u201cOur predecessors do not seem to have been very enterprising. The valley has great potentialities for an assault course and a mortar range. Weapon- training officer, make a recce this morning and get something laid on before Brigade arrives.\u201d \u201cVery good, sir.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going out myself with the adjutant to recce training areas. Anyone happen to know this district?\u201d I said nothing. \u201cThat\u2019s all then, get cracking.\u201d \u201cWonderful old place in its way,\u201d said the Quartering Commandant; \u201cpity to knock it about too much.\u201d He was an old, retired, re-appointed lieutenant-colonel from some miles away. We met in the space before the main doors, where I had my half- company fallen-in, waiting for orders. \u201cCome in. I\u2019ll soon show you over. It\u2019s a great warren of a place, but we\u2019ve only requisitioned the ground floor and half a dozen bedrooms. Everything else upstairs is still private property,mostly cram-full of furniture; you never saw such stuff, priceless some of it. \u201cThere\u2019s a caretaker and a couple of old servants live at the top\u2014they won\u2019t be any trouble to you\u2014and a blitzed R.C. padre whom Lady Julia gave a home to\u2014jittery old bird, but no trouble. He\u2019s opened the chapel; that\u2019s in bounds for the troops; surprising lot use it, too. \u201cThe place belongs to Lady Julia Flyte, as she calls herself now. She was married to Mottram, the Minister of what-ever-it-is. She\u2019s abroad in some woman\u2019s service, and I try to keep an eye on things for her. Queer thing the old marquis leaving everything to her\u2014rough on the boys. \u201cNow this is where the last lot put the clerks; plenty of room, anyway. I\u2019ve had the walls and fireplaces boarded up you see\u2014valuable old work underneath. Hullo, someone seems to have been making a beast of himself here; destructive beggars, soldiers are! Lucky we spotted it, or it would have been charged to you chaps. \u201cThis is another good-sized room, used to be full of tapestry. I\u2019d advise you to use this for conferences.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m only here to clean up, sir. Someone from Brigade will allot the rooms.\u201d \u201cOh, well, you\u2019ve got an easy job. Very decent fellows the last lot. They shouldn\u2019t have done that to the fireplace though. How did they manage it? Looks solid enough. I wonder if it can be mended? \u201cI expect the brigadier will take this for his office; the last did. It\u2019s got a lot of painting that can\u2019t be moved, done on the walls. As you see, I\u2019ve covered it up as best I can, but soldiers get through anything\u2014as the brigadier\u2019s done in the corner. There was another painted room, outside under pillars\u2014modern work but, if you ask me, the prettiest in the place; it was the signal office and they made absolute hay of it; rather a shame. \u201cThis eyesore is what they used as the mess; that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t cover it up; not that it would matter much if it did get damaged; always reminds me of one of the costlier knocking-shops, you know\u2014\u2018 Maison Japonaise \u2019\u2026 and this was the ante-room\u2026\u201d It did not take us long to make our tour of the echoing rooms. Then we went outside on the terrace. \u201cThose are the other ranks\u2019 latrines and wash-house; can\u2019t think why they built them just there; it was done before I took the job over. All this used to be cut off from the front. We laid the road through the trees joining it up with the main drive; unsightly but very practical; awful lot of transport comes in and out; cuts the place up, too. Look where one careless devil went smack through the box-hedge and carried away all that balustrade; did it with a three-ton lorry, too; you\u2019d think he had a Churchill tank at least.\u201cThat fountain is rather a tender spot with our landlady; the young officers used to lark about in it on guest nights and it was looking a bit the worse for wear, so I wired it in and turned the water off. Looks a bit untidy now; all the drivers throw their cigarette-ends and the remains of the sandwiches there, and you can\u2019t get to it to clean it up, since I put the wire round it. Florid great thing, isn\u2019t it?\u2026 \u201cWell, if you\u2019ve seen everything I\u2019ll push off. Good day to you.\u201d His driver threw a cigarette into the dry basin of the fountain; saluted and opened the door of the car. I saluted and the Quartering Commandant drove away through the new, metaled gap in the lime trees. \u201cHooper,\u201d I said, when I had seen my men started, \u201cdo you think I can safely leave you in charge of the work-party for half an hour?\u201d \u201cI was just wondering where we could scrounge some tea.\u201d \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake,\u201d I said, \u201cthey\u2019ve only just begun work.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re awfully browned off.\u201d \u201cKeep them at it.\u201d \u201cRightyoh.\u201d I did not spend long in the desolate ground-floor rooms, but went upstairs and wandered down the familiar corridors, trying doors that were locked, opening doors into rooms piled to the ceiling with furniture. At length I met an old housemaid carrying a cup of tea. \u201cWhy,\u201d she said, \u201cisn\u2019t it Mr. Ryder?\u201d \u201cIt is. I was wondering when I should meet someone I know.\u201d \u201cMrs. Hawkins is up in her old room. I was just taking her some tea.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll take it for you,\u201d I said, and passed through the baize doors, up the uncarpeted stairs, to the nursery. Nanny Hawkins did not recognize me until I spoke, and my arrival threw her into some confusion; it was not until I had been sitting some time by her fireside that she recovered her old calm. She, who had changed so little in all the years I knew her, had lately become greatly aged. The changes of the last years had come too late in her life to be accepted and understood; her sight was failing, she told me, and she could see only the coarsest needlework. Her speech, sharpened by years of gentle conversation, had reverted now to the soft, peasant tones of its origin. \u201c\u2026 only myself here and the two girls and poor Father Membling who was blown up, not a roof to his head nor a stick of furniture till Julia took him in with the kind heart she\u2019s got, and his nerves something shocking\u2026 Lady Brideshead, too, Marchmain it is now, who I ought by rights to call her Ladyship now, but it doesn\u2019t come natural, it was the same with her. First, when Julia and Cordelia left to the war, she came here with the two boys and then the military turned them out, so they went to London, nor they hadn\u2019tbeen in their house not a month, and Bridey away with the yeomanry the same as his poor Lordship, when they were blown up too, everything gone, all the furniture she brought here and kept in the coach-house. Then she had another house outside London, and the military took that, too, and there she is now, when I last heard, in a hotel at the seaside, which isn\u2019t the same as your own home, is it? It doesn\u2019t seem right. \u201c\u2026 Did you listen to Mr. Mottram last night? Very nasty he was about Hitler. I said to the girl Effie who does for me: \u2018If Hitler was listening, and if he understands English, which I doubt, he must feel very small.\u2019 Who would have thought of Mr. Mottram doing so well? And so many of his friends, too, that used to stay here? I said to Mr. Wilcox, who comes to see me regular on the \u2019bus from Melstead twice a month, which is very good of him and I appreciate it, I said: \u2018We were entertaining angels unawares,\u2019 because Mr. Wilcox never liked Mr. Mottram\u2019s friends, which I never saw, but used to hear about from all of you, nor Julia didn\u2019t like them, but they\u2019ve done very well, haven\u2019t they?\u201d At last I asked her: \u201cHave you heard from Julia?\u201d \u201cFrom Cordelia, only last week, and they\u2019re together still as they have been all the time, and Julia sent me love at the bottom of the page. They\u2019re both very well, though they couldn\u2019t say where, but Father Membling said, reading between the lines, it was Palestine, which is where Bridey\u2019s yeomanry is, so that\u2019s very nice for them all. Cordelia said they were looking forward to coming home after the war, which I am sure we all are, though whether I live to see it, is another story.\u201d I stayed with her for half an hour, and left promising to return often. When I reached the hall I found no sign of work and Hooper looking guilty. \u201cThey had to go off to draw the bed-straw. I didn\u2019t know till Sergeant Block told me. I don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re coming back.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know? What orders did you give?\u201d \u201cWell, I told Sergeant Block to bring them back if he thought it was worthwhile; I mean if there was time before dinner.\u201d It was nearly twelve. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hotted again, Hooper. That straw was to be drawn any time before six tonight.\u201d \u201cOh Lor; sorry, Ryder. Sergeant Block\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my own fault for going away\u2026. Fall in the same party immediately after dinner, bring them back here and keep them here till the job\u2019s done.\u201d \u201cRightyoh. I say, did you say you knew this place before?\u201d \u201cYes, very well. It belongs to friends of mine,\u201d and as I said the words they sounded as odd in my ears as Sebastian\u2019s had done, when, instead of saying, \u201cIt is my home,\u201d he said, \u201cIt is where my family live.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to make any sense\u2014one family in a place this size. What\u2019s the use of it?\u201d \u201cWell, I suppose Brigade are finding it useful.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s not what it was built for, is it?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cnot what it was built for. Perhaps that\u2019s one of the pleasures of building, like having a son, wondering how he\u2019ll grow up. I don\u2019t know; I never built anything, and I forfeited the right to watch my son grow up. I\u2019m homeless, childless, middle-aged, love-less, Hooper.\u201d He looked to see if I was being funny, decided that I was, and laughed. \u201cNow go back to camp, keep out of the C.O.\u2019s way, if he\u2019s back from his recce, and don\u2019t let on to anyone that we\u2019ve made a nonsense of the morning.\u201d \u201cOkey, Ryder.\u201d There was one part of the house I had not yet visited, and I went there now. The chapel showed no ill-effects of its long neglect; the art-nouveau paint was as fresh and bright as ever; the art-nouveau lamp burned once more before the altar. I said a prayer, an ancient, newly-learned form of words, and left, turning towards the camp; and as I walked back, and the cook-house bugle sounded ahead of me, I thought: \u201cThe builders did not know the uses to which their work would descend; they made a new house with the stones of the old castle; year by year, generation after generation, they enriched and extended it; year by year the great harvest of timber in the park grew to ripeness; until, in sudden frost, came the age of Hooper; the place was desolate and the work all brought to nothing; Quomodo sedet sola civitas. Vanity of vanities, all is vanity. \u201cAnd yet,\u201d I thought, stepping out more briskly towards the camp, where the bugles after a pause had taken up the second call and were sounding \u201cPick-em-up, pick-em-up, hot potatoes,\u201d \u201cand yet that is not the last word; it is not even an apt word; it is a dead word from ten years back. \u201cSomething quite remote from anything the builders intended, has come out of their work, and out of the fierce little human tragedy in which I played; something none of us thought about at the time; a small red flame\u2014a beaten- copper lamp of deplorable design relit before the beaten-copper doors of a tabernacle; the flame which the old knights saw from their tombs, which they saw put out; that flame burns again for other soldiers, far from home, farther, in heart, than Acre or Jerusalem. It could not have been lit but for the builders and the tragedians, and there I found it this morning, burning anew among the old stones.\u201d I quickened my pace and reached the hut which served us for our ante- room. \u201cYou\u2019re looking unusually cheerful today,\u201d said the second-in-command.Reading Group Guide Brideshead Revisited The Sacred and Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder by EVELYN WAUGHEvelyn Waugh wrote Brideshead Revisited while on leave from the British army during World War II. Following is a selection of letters he wrote to his literary agent, A. D. Peters, and close friend Nancy Mitford about the writing and publication of the book.To A. D. Peters February 8, 1944 Easton Court Hotel, Chagford, Devon Dear Peter, Could you please tell me the new address of Mr. McLachlan the typist? I am busy on the novel, have done over 10,000 words and, if the military do not disturb me, should finish it by the middle of May. It would have a small public at any time. I should not think six Americans will understand it. Would it be prudent to warn Gatfield 1 to expect a manuscript for his Christmas publication? He would then be able to reserve some paper. I am concerned with the quality rather than the quantity of Gatfield\u2019s work. I take it that the regulations only prescribe how big the margins shall be and how small the print? They do not categorically enforce bad typography? And is there any paper of better quality than others? Would Littlebrown 2 care to produce an edition deluxe or at least de propriete? I should like this book to be in decent form because it is very good. Failing all else can Gatfield get handmade paper for twenty copies or so at my expense? My salutes to Henrie. I am in better shape than when I last saw her and you. Yours Ever, Evelyn Would it interest you to see the first 2 chapters in their first typed version or will you wait until it is finished? You might be able to guess how many yanks and Bevin-boys 3 will be able to understand it. To A. D. Peters April 3, 1944 Easton Court Hotel, Chagford, Devon Dear Pete, My Magnum Opus is turning into a jeroboam. I have written 62,000 words of which I enclose half. The rest is typing. A problem vexes me on which I should value your advice: The original scheme of the book was three sections, of which two are complete. The total length will be about 90,000 words. I now find that what I have written could be profitably enlarged and what I have to write could be an entire book. The leisure at my disposal is limited. Should I be well advised to expand what I have written to 70,000 words and publish it as Vol. I, leaving the second for next year? Supposing that by next year paper is again abundant we could publish a single volume of 120,000 words incorporating the first volume which would have had the limited circulation of the time. Expansion would be an artistic benefit. Evelyn Please retain MS for time being. It is a first draft requiring much alteration even if there is no expansion. To A. D. Peters [Received May 20, 1944] Easton Court Hotel, Chagford, Devon Dear Pete, Many thanks for your congratulations. Both well; no nanny. 4 How about \u201cSacred and Profane\u201d on the cover; \u201cThe Sacred and Profane Memories of Capt. Charles Ryder\u201d on the title page? Yes, Lady Marchmain is an enigma. I hoped the last conversation with Cordelia gave a theological clue. The whole thing is steeped in theology, but I begin to agree that theologians won\u2019t recognize it. Duck into hare shall stop. 5 I wish I could dine, but I am glad of the reason for not being able to. I am steaming ahead with the novel. It is becoming painfully erotic. Yours, Evelyn To A. D. Peters September 30, 1944 \u201cM\u201d Military Mission C.M.F. [Topusko, Croatia] Dear Peter, \u2026 Littlebrown must on no account change the title of BR without submitting the alternative for my approval. I think it most unlikely I shall agree. He can call it \u201cA Household of Faith\u201d if he likes. I am writing to Gatfield by this post asking for a set of galley proofs by air mail so that I can revise the first half. The changes may be extensive. \u2026 Randolph 6 does not want to write his war memoirs but will come and see you when he gets home to discuss doing business with you. You may find him offensive. Most people do. I seldom. Time passes very slowly in this backwater. 7 Yours, Evelyn To Nancy Mitford January 7, 1945 37 Military Mission Dubrovnik, Croatia Dearest Nancy, Yes, I know what you mean; he is dim, 8 but then he is telling the story and it is not his story. It is all right for Benvenuto Cellini 9 to be undim, but he is telling his own story and no one else\u2019s. I think the crucial question is: does Julia\u2019s love for him seem real or is he so dim that it falls flat; if the latter, the book fails plainly. He was a bad painter. Well he was as bad at painting as Osbert [Sitwell] is at writing; for Christ\u2019s sake don\u2019t repeat that comparison to anyone . Lady Marchmain, 10 no I am not on her side; but God is, who suffers fools gladly; and the book is about God. Does that answer it? Bad about the clip. 11 Too late for the first edition and there are no second editions these days. I knew I should have submitted it to you for criticism. The definitive (ha ha) edition is substantially different from the first, so if you really feel disposed to re-read it, as you say, wait a month or two for that. A lovely parcel of books from you. Connolly\u2019s Grave. 12 What he writes about Christianity is such twaddle\u2014real twaddle\u2014no sense or interest, that it shakes me. And he seems ashamed of that part of himself\u2014as a soft, skeptical old good liver. I am shocked by Grave . But I have read only five or six pages. My father was a better classical scholar than Connolly, but he did not trot out his recondite quotations in at all that way. I think Connolly has lived too much with communist young ladies. He must spend more time at Whites. 13 So today is Orthodox Christmas and I was asked to tea by the military at 3pm. One never knows what one will get in this country. Today we were seated at tables, without a greeting from our hosts, and given (a) green chartreuse, (b) tea and ham sandwiches, (c) cakes and cherry brandy and cigarettes, (d) two patriotic speeches. Then it seemed reasonable to think the party was over, but no, in came cold mutton and red wine. It is unsettling at my age.50 copies of Brideshead Revisited went out, 40 of them to close friends of yours. Do please keep your ear to the ground and report what they say. For the first time since 1928, I am eager about a book. Love, Evelyn To Nancy Mitford February 4, 1945 37 Military Mission Dubrovnik, Croatia Darling Nancy, Well those were two splendid letters. What a bob\u2019s worth\u2014theology, belles-lettres, biography\u2014the whole of the Everyman Library. First, Belles-lettres . How delighted I am to hear you are writing a Great English Classic too. What a subject! 14 Tell your publisher at once or there will not be paper for months after it is written. The first person singular is a most treacherous form of narration, I found. It is so fatally easy in some ways, one can go on and on almost effortlessly and then one comes up against something which \u201cI\u201d cannot possibly say, which must be said. I believe you will manage it more skillfully than I did. I pant for the proofs. Theology . There is no doubt that God does like dunces, repugnant as it is. 15 I think it is like the lower classes\u2014everyone loves the simple gaffer until he starts telling us what he heard on The Brains Trust the evening before. We are all very lower class to God and our cleverness and second-hand scholarship bore him hideously. I don\u2019t like your defense of Windsor and Mrs. S. 16 It is certainly true that people often feel qualms of conscience about illicit love only when they are beginning to get bored; also that self restraint usually takes the form of not falling in love but rather falling and then having a dramatic renunciation. But it must be nonsense to say people never give up sleeping together for \u201cabstract\u201d principles. Anyhow why \u201cabstract\u201d? Is the crown of England or the love of God abstract? Of course with Julia Flyte the fact that the war was coming and she saw her life coming to an end anyhow, made a difference. Biography or Medicine . Croatia is thrilled about Lennox-Boyd\u2019s elephantiasis. 17 Army signals busy supplying Randolph with clinical details. I think it may have some connection with Guiness\u2019 zoo advertising. 18 Now Simon. 19 I can\u2019t make out from your description\u2014 stark, is the word\u2014whether he was blown up by V2 or struck down inhis prime like Lord Randolph. 20 If you put it in a book no one would think it at all \u201cconvincing.\u201d Heaven help us when you atheists get full control as in Germany and go round the sick rooms murdering the sick and infirm. I should be an early victim. My blood pressure is giving me trouble again. Drama . Diane Abdy writes to me that her life is \u201cre-orientated.\u201d What does she mean? Criticism . It is interesting how all the English think my G.E.C. 21 Rom-ish propaganda. You never hear them speak of Henry Yorke 22 as writing atheist propaganda. Penelope Betjeman has written me a long letter treating the story purely as a controversial tract. Katharine Asquith on the other hand writes, \u201cWhen will you stop writing novels and try your hand at a book?\u201d Pansy Lamb says I give an entirely false view of debutante life in the early \u201920s. It is heaven for me hearing all these criticisms. Autobiography . My life continues very easy, comfortable, irresponsible, safe. I know the stones of Ragusa well and can tell what is genuine Italian and what is Slav imitation. Most of my day is spent dealing with pathetic people of confused nationality seeking to escape the horrors of liberation. I was called on by a man who looked just like Professor Joad who introduced himself, \u201cI am the poet Kosov.\u201d He gave me the English translation of a play of his called, literally, \u201cPassion\u2019s Furnace.\u201d\u2026 Mr. Kosov stayed to luncheon and left very tipsy quoting Rimbaud in German. We had a sad little festival yesterday when the partisans made the people observe St. Blaise\u2019s Day with all of its ceremonies\u2014no tourists, no peasants in from the villages, the inhabitants too weak from hunger to stand and too scared of the secret police to sneeze. Why cannot you send Prod here to help civilian relief. 23 He would be very welcome to yours truly. Bless him you never mention him now. The Savile Club I suppose. Thank you very much for Love on the Supertax which arrived today. I haven\u2019t opened it yet but look forward to doing so. All love, EvelynQuestions and topics for discussion 1. Some consider Brideshead Revisited to be a novel about love, some think it is about family, and others the waning powers of British aristocracy. Evelyn Waugh considered it to be a book about religion. Do you think it is only one of these things, or could it be about all of them? 2. In his letter to A. D. Peters, Waugh wrote, \u201cI hoped the last conversation with Cordelia gave a theological clue.\u201d What does Cordelia say that reveals Waugh\u2019s true intentions? 3. In 1944, Henry Wallace, then vice president of the United States, declared that the twentieth century was \u201cthe century of the common man.\u201d This statement caused much discussion in England, and because of it Waugh\u2019s portrayal of Hooper, the representative \u201ccommon man\u201d in Brideshead Revisited, attracted controversy from the book\u2019s critics. Do you find the portrayal of Captain Hooper offensive? Is the class issue still relevant today, or is it particular to the time in which the book was published? 4. When we first meet Sebastian, he carries a teddy bear with him wherever he goes. Why does he carry the teddy? To what degree is Sebastian still a boy when we meet him? How much of this behavior is affected and how much is genuine? 5. How much of Charles\u2019s identity is influenced by his relationship with the Flyte family? 6. Though they were all raised in the same household, each Flyte child has a different relationship with Catholicism. How would you define the differing feelings that Bridey, Julia, Sebastian, and Cordelia haveabout their religion? 7. What draws Charles to Sebastian? And what draws Sebastian to Charles? Several times Charles refers to Sebastian as \u201cthe forerunner\u201d to his love for Julia. What do you think he means? 8. Infidelity is treated casually by those in Charles and Julia\u2019s social circle. When the two decide they love each other and want to marry, their relationship becomes much more controversial. Is marriage an act of love in the world of Brideshead Revisited ? 9. When Bridey tells Julia she is \u201cliving in sin,\u201d it has a great effect on her. Do you think she had never thought of this before? Is it the first time Charles becomes aware of how greatly their \u201csins\u201d sit on her? 10. The final impediment to Charles and Julia\u2019s marriage is that in the eyes of the Catholic Church, he is still married to Celia\u2014despite their state-issued divorce. Waugh faced a similar situation in his own life when he decided to marry his second wife, and subsequently pursued an annulment from his first wife (despite their being legally divorced). Why do you think he chose not to make this a part of Charles and Julia\u2019s love story? 11. There are three significant deaths in Julia\u2019s life\u2014her mother\u2019s, her father\u2019s, and that of her stillborn child with Rex. How do these deaths effect her decisions in life? 12. Charles is not a writer by profession, but as Julia points out he sees everything \u201csecond-hand\u201d as if they were in a play. Is this his personality, or a way of explaining his role of narrator?Suggested reading Curious to find out more about Evelyn Waugh? Here are some titles worth investigating.

He was educated at Lancing and Hertford College, Oxford, where he majored in journalism and modern history. Waugh\u2019s first book, Rossetti: His Life and Works, was published in 1928. Soon afterward his first novel, Decline and Fall, appeared and his career was sensationally launched. \u201cIn fifteen novels of cunning construction and lapidary eloquence,\u201d Time summarized later, \u201cEvelyn Waugh developed a wickedly hilarious yet fundamentally religious assault on a century that, in his opinion, had ripped up the nourishing taproot of tradition and let wither all the dear things of the world.\u201d Apart from his novels, Waugh also wrote several acclaimed travel books, two additional biographies, and an autobiography, A Little Learning .
