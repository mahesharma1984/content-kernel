## 4. Alignment Effect

This alignment achieves a profound integration of emotional intimacy and moral instruction by combining FP-INT-REL narrative voice with CHAR-mediated TIGHT alignment through ACCUMULATION. The RETRO temporal distance allows mature wisdom to illuminate past struggles without undermining their emotional authenticity, while the TRANS alignment structure tracks genuine character development rather than mere plot progression. Devices like Foreshadowing and Symbolism create thematic coherence across Jane's journey, while Dramatic Irony and First-Person Narration maintain both surprise and intimacy. The result transforms readers into moral witnesses who experience Jane's emotional reality while gaining access to the retrospective wisdom that frames her growth, creating the distinctive bildungsroman effect where personal development becomes universal moral education.
