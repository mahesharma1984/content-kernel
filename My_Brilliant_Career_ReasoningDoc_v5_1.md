## 1. Alignment Pattern

**Pattern**: Passionate Self-Advocacy

**Core Dynamic**: First-person narration with strong subjective stance creates intimate access to protagonist's defiant consciousness while narrator advocates for her own aspirations and struggles.

**Reader Effect**: Readers experience direct immersion in the protagonist's passionate worldview, generating both empathy for her constraints and investment in her rebellious spirit.

## 2. Macro Variable Justifications

**Narrative Voice**: The FP (first-person) POV with INT (internal) focalization creates unmediated access to Sybylla's consciousness, establishing the foundation for passionate self-advocacy. REL (reliable) narration ensures readers trust her perspective while RETRO (retrospective) temporal distance allows mature reflection on youthful rebellion. SOME intrusion permits direct reader address, strengthening advocacy stance.

**Narrative Structure**: LIN (linear) chronology follows Sybylla's developmental journey chronologically, while MONO (monomythic) architecture focuses entirely on her singular quest for independence. VAR (variable) pacing allows passionate moments to breathe while AB_OVO beginning establishes her worldview immediately. OPEN ending maintains her ongoing struggle for self-determination.

**Rhetorical Voice**: SUBJ (subjective) stance is crucial for passionate advocacy—Sybylla never pretends objectivity about her situation. The passionate, defiant tone directly expresses her rebellious spirit while COLL (colloquial) register creates intimacy with readers. SIT (situational) irony highlights the gap between her aspirations and circumstances.

**Rhetorical Structure**: TRANS (transformational) alignment tracks Sybylla's evolving self-advocacy from frustrated desire to determined action. TIGHT narrator-rhetor relationship means Sybylla's voice is Franklin's vehicle for advocacy. CHAR (character-driven) mechanism centers everything on Sybylla's passionate nature. ACCUMULATION mediation builds layers of evidence for her position through repeated experiences of constraint and rebellion.

## 3. Device Selections by Freytag Section

**Exposition**: First-Person Narration establishes intimate access while Imagery and Metaphor create vivid sensory connection to her world. Juxtaposition contrasts her dreams with reality, Repetition emphasizes key frustrations, and Symbolism (particularly natural imagery) represents her wild, untamed spirit. These devices establish the pattern by immediately immersing readers in her passionate perspective.

**Rising Action**: First-Person Narration deepens intimacy as stakes rise. Juxtaposition intensifies between aspiration and limitation while Metaphor and Symbolism develop her identity as artistic rebel. Foreshadowing builds tension around her choices while Imagery maintains visceral connection. Hyperbole captures her emotional extremes. These devices develop the pattern by escalating her passionate advocacy.

**Climax**: First-Person Narration reaches peak intimacy during crucial decisions. Internal Monologue provides direct access to her reasoning while Metaphor and Imagery create emotional intensity. Juxtaposition presents stark choices and Symbolism crystallizes her values. Dialogue reveals external pressure against her advocacy. These devices intensify the pattern at the moment of greatest conflict between passion and expectation.

**Falling Action**: First-Person Narration maintains intimacy while processing consequences. Apostrophe allows direct passionate address while Imagery and Juxtaposition show the gap between choice and outcome. Internal Monologue reveals her continued self-advocacy despite difficulties. These devices pivot the pattern from external conflict to internal resolution of her advocacy stance.

**Resolution**: First-Person Narration concludes with mature reflection while maintaining passionate voice. Metaphor and Imagery create lasting impressions of her journey. Juxtaposition shows how she's changed while remaining true to her advocacy. Internal Monologue, Dialogue, and Apostrophe demonstrate her evolved but uncompromised self-advocacy.

## 4. Alignment Effect

This alignment creates a literary experience where readers become intimate witnesses to and advocates for Sybylla's passionate struggle for self-determination. The SUBJ stance combined with FP narration and TIGHT narrator-rhetor relationship ensures readers experience her constraints and aspirations as personally urgent rather than merely observed. The CHAR mechanism powered by ACCUMULATION mediation builds overwhelming evidence for her position through repeated cycles of passionate desire meeting social constraint. Priority devices like Internal Monologue and Apostrophe provide direct access to her advocacy voice, while Juxtaposition and Imagery make abstract concepts of freedom and constraint viscerally real. The TRANS alignment structure guides readers through her evolution from frustrated dreamer to determined advocate, while the OPEN ending ensures her passionate voice continues beyond the text, leaving readers invested in her ongoing struggle for brilliant independence.
