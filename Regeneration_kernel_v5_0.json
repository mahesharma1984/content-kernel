      "chapter_text": "inthat last scrap.\u201d You don\u2019t talk like that if you\u2019ve watched them die.\u2019\u2018No intelligent or sensitive person would talk like that anyway.\u2019A slightly awkward pause. \u2018I\u2019m not saying there are no exceptions.\u2019Rivers laughed. \u2018The point is you hate civilians, don\u2019t you? The\u201ccallous\u201d, the \u201ccomplacent\u201d, the \u201cunimaginative\u201d. Or is \u201chate\u201d too strong aword?\u2019\u2018No.\u2019\u2018So. What you felt for the Germans, rather briefly, in the spring of lastyear, you now feel for the overwhelming majority of your fellow-countrymen?\u2019\u2018Yes.\u2019\u2018You know, I think you were quite right not to say too much to theBoard.\u2019\u2018That wasn\u2019t my idea, it was Graves\u2019s. He was afraid I\u2019d sound too sane.\u2019\u2018When you said the Board was \u201crigged\u201d, what did you mean?\u2019\u2018I meant the decision to send me here, or or somewhere similar, had beentaken before I went in.\u2019\u2018And this had all been fixed by Captain Graves?\u2019\u2018Yes.\u2019 Sassoon leant forward. \u2018The point is they weren\u2019t going to court-martial me. They were just going to lock me up somewhere \u2026\u2019 He lookedround the room. \u2018Worse than this.\u2019Rivers smiled. \u2018There are worse places, believe me.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m sure there are,\u2019 Sassoon said politely.\u2018They were going to certify you, in fact?\u2019\u2018I suppose so.\u2019\u2018Did anybody on the Board say anything to you about this?\u2019\u2018No, because it was \u2013\u2019\u2018All fixed beforehand. Yes, I see.\u2019Sassoon said, \u2018May I ask you a question?\u2019\u2018Go ahead\u2019\u2018Do you think I\u2019m mad?\u2019\u2018No, of course you\u2019re not mad. Did you think you were going mad?\u2019\u2018It crossed my mind. You know when you\u2019re brought face to face withthe fact that, yes, you did see corpses on the pavement \u2026\u2019\u2018Hallucinations in the half-waking state are surprisingly common, youknow. They\u2019re not the same thing as psychotic hallucinations. Childrenhave them quite frequently.\u2019Sassoon had started pulling at a loose thread on the breast of his tunic.Rivers watched him for a while. \u2018You must\u2019ve been in agony when you didthat.\u2019Sassoon lowered his hand. \u2018No-o. Agony\u2019s lying in a shell-hole with yourlegs shot off. I was upset.\u2019 For a moment he looked almost hostile, then herelaxed. \u2018It was a futile gesture. I\u2019m not particularly proud of it.\u2019\u2018You threw it in the Mersey, didn\u2019t you?\u2019\u2018Yes. It wasn\u2019t heavy enough to sink, so it just\u2019 \u2013 a glint of amusement \u2013\u2018bobbed around. There was a ship sailing past, quite a long way out, in theestuary, and I looked at this little scrap of ribbon floating and I looked at theship, and I thought that me trying to stop the war was a bit like trying tostop the ship would have been. You know, all they\u2019d\u2019ve seen from the deckwas this little figure jumping up and down, waving its arms, and theywouldn\u2019t\u2019ve known what on earth it was getting so excited about.\u2019\u2018So you realized then that it was futile?\u2019Sassoon lifted his head. \u2018It still had to be done. You can\u2019t just acquiesce.\u2019Rivers hesitated. \u2018Look, I think we\u2019ve \u2026 we\u2019ve got about as far as wecan get today. You must be very tired.\u2019 He stood up. \u2018I\u2019ll see you tomorrowmorning at ten. Oh, and could you ask Captain Graves to see me as soon ashe arrives?\u2019Sassoon stood up. \u2018You said a bit back you didn\u2019t think I was mad.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m quite sure you\u2019re not. As a matter of fact I don\u2019t even think you\u2019vegot a war neurosis.\u2019Sassoon digested this. \u2018What have I got, then?\u2019\u2018You seem to have a very powerful anti-war neurosis.\u2019They looked at each other and laughed. Rivers said, \u2018You realize, don\u2019tyou, that it\u2019s my duty to \u2026 to try to change that? I can\u2019t pretend to beneutral.\u2019Sassoon\u2019s glance took in both their uniforms. \u2018No, of course not.\u2019Rivers made a point of sitting next to Bryce at dinner.\u2018Well,\u2019 Bryce said, \u2018what did you make of him?\u2019\u2018I can\u2019t find anything wrong. He doesn\u2019t show any sign of depression,he\u2019s not excited \u2013\u2019\u2018Physically?\u2019\u2018Nothing.\u2019\u2018Perhaps he just doesn\u2019t want to be killed.\u2019\u2018Oh, I think he\u2019d be most insulted if you suggested that. To be fair, he didhave a job lined up in Cambridge, training cadets \u2013 so it isn\u2019t a question ofavoiding being sent back. He could\u2019ve taken that if he\u2019d wanted to save hisskin.\u2019\u2018Any trace of \u2026 er \u2026 religious enthusiasm?\u2019\u2018No, I\u2019m afraid not. I was hoping for that too.\u2019They looked at each other, amused. \u2018You know, the curious thing is Idon\u2019t think he\u2019s even a pacifist? It seems to be entirely a matter of horror atthe extent of the slaughter, combined with a feeling of anger that thegovernment won\u2019t state its war aims and impose some kind of limitation onthe whole thing. That, and an absolutely corrosive hatred of civilians. Andnon-combatants in uniform.\u2019\u2018What an uncomfortable time you must\u2019ve had.\u2019\u2018No-o, I rather gather I was seen as an exception.\u2019Bryce looked amused. \u2018Did you like him?\u2019\u2018Yes, very much. And I found him \u2026 much more impressive than Iexpected.\u2019Sassoon, at his table under the window, sat in silence. The men on eitherside of him stammered so badly that conversation would have beenimpossible, even if he had wished for it, but he was content to withdrawinto his own thoughts.He remembered the day before Arras, staggering from the outpost trenchto the main trench and back again, carrying boxes of trench mortar bombs,passing the same corpses time after time, until their twisted and blackenedshapes began to seem like old friends. At one point he\u2019d had to pass twohands sticking up out of a heap of pocked and pitted chalk, like the roots ofan overturned tree. No way of telling if they were British or German hands.No way of persuading himself it mattered.\u2018Do you play golf?\u2019\u2018I\u2019m sorry?\u2019\u2018I asked if you played golf.\u2019Small blue eyes, nibbled gingery moustache, an RAMC badge. He heldout his hand. \u2018Ralph Anderson.\u2019Sassoon shook hands and introduced himself. \u2018Yes, I do.\u2019\u2018What\u2019s your handicap?\u2019Sassoon told him. After all, why not? It seemed an entirely suitable topicfor Bedlam.\u2018Ah, then we might have a game.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t brought my clubs.\u2019\u2018Send for them. Some of the best courses in the country round here.\u2019Sassoon had opened his mouth to reply when a commotion started nearthe door. As far as he could tell, somebody seemed to have been sick. Atany rate, a thin, yellow-skinned man was on his feet, choking and gagging.A couple of VADs ran across to him, clucking, fussing, flappingineffectually at his tunic with a napkin, until eventually they had the senseto get him out of the room. The swing doors closed behind them. Amoment\u2019s silence, and then, as if nothing had happened, the buzz ofconversation rose again.Rivers stood up and pushed his plate away. \u2018I think I\u2019d better go.\u2019\u2018Why not wait till you\u2019ve finished?\u2019 Bryce said. \u2018You eat little enough asit is.\u2019Rivers patted his midriff. \u2018Oh, I shan\u2019t fade away just yet.\u2019Whenever Rivers wanted to get to the top floor without being stoppedhalf a dozen times on the way, he used the back staircase. Pipes lined thewalls, twisting with the turning of the stair, gurgling from time to time likelengths of human intestine. It was dark, the air stuffy, and sweat began toprickle in the roots of his hair. It was a relief to push the swing door openand come out on to the top corridor, where the air was cool at least, thoughhe never failed to be depressed by the long narrow passage with its doublerow of brown doors and the absence of natural light. \u2018Like a trench withoutthe sky\u2019 had been one patient\u2019s description, and he was afraid it was onlytoo accurate.Burns was sitting on his bed, while two VADs helped him off with histunic and shirt. His collar bones and ribs were clearly visible beneath theyellowish skin. The waistband of his breeches gaped.One of the VADs tugged at it. \u2018There\u2019s room for two in there,\u2019 she said,smiling, coaxing. \u2018Have I to get in with you?\u2019 The other VAD\u2019s frozenexpression warned her of Rivers\u2019s presence. \u2018I\u2019ll get this sponged down foryou, Captain.\u2019They hurried past Rivers, bursting into nervous giggles as they reachedthe end of the corridor.Burns\u2019s arms were goose-pimpled, though the room was not cold. Thesmell of vomit lingered on his breath. Rivers sat down beside him. Hedidn\u2019t know what to say, and thought it better to say nothing. After a whilehe felt the bed begin to shake and put his arm round Burns\u2019s shoulders. \u2018Itdoesn\u2019t get any better, does it?\u2019 he said.Burns shook his head. After a while Rivers got up, fetched Burns\u2019s coatfrom the peg behind the door and wrapped it round his shoulders. \u2018Would itbe easier to eat in your own room?\u2019\u2018A bit. I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about upsetting other people.\u2019Yes, Burns would worry about upsetting other people. Perhaps the mostdistressing feature of his case was the occasional glimpse of the cheerfuland likeable young man he must once have been.Rivers looked down at Burns\u2019s forearms, noting that the groove betweenradius and ulna was even deeper than it had been a week ago. \u2018Would ithelp to have a bowl of fruit in your room?\u2019 he asked. \u2018So you could justpick something up when you felt like it?\u2019\u2018Yes, that might help.\u2019Rivers got up and walked across to the window. He\u2019s agreeing to makeme feel useful, he thought. \u2018All right, I\u2019ll get them to send something up.\u2019The shadows of the beech trees had begun to creep across the tennis courts,which were empty now. Rivers turned from the window. \u2018What kind ofnight did you have?\u2019\u2018Not too good.\u2019\u2018Have you made any progress with what we talked about?\u2019\u2018Not really.\u2019 He looked up at Rivers. \u2018I can\u2019t make myself think about it.\u2019\u2018No, well, it\u2019s early days.\u2019\u2018You know, the worst thing is \u2026\u2019 \u2013 Burns was scanning Rivers\u2019s face \u2013\u2018that it\u2019s a \u2026 a joke.\u2019\u2018Yes.\u2019After leaving Burns, Rivers went up a further short flight of stairs andunlocked the door to the tower. Apart from his own bedroom, this was theonly place in Craiglockhart he could hope to be alone for more than a fewminutes. The patients weren\u2019t allowed out here, in case the hundred-footdrop to the path below should prove too tempting an exit from the war. Herested his arms on the iron balustrade and looked out towards the hills.Burns. Rivers had become adept at finding bearable aspects to unbearableexperiences, but Burns defeated him. What had happened to him was sovile, so disgusting, that Rivers could find no redeeming feature. He\u2019d beenthrown into the air by the explosion of a shell and had landed, head-first, ona German corpse, whose gas-filled belly had ruptured on impact. BeforeBurns lost consciousness, he\u2019d had time to realize that what filled his noseand mouth was decomposing human flesh. Now, whenever he tried to eat,that taste and smell recurred. Nightly, he relived the experience, and fromevery nightmare he awoke vomiting. Burns on his knees, as Rivers hadoften seen him, retching up the last ounce of bile, hardly looked like ahuman being at all. His body seemed to have become merely the skin-and-bone casing for a tormented alimentary canal. His suffering was withoutpurpose or dignity, and yes, Rivers knew exactly what Burns meant whenhe said it was a joke.Rivers became aware that he was gripping the edge of the parapet andconsciously relaxed his hands. Whenever he spent any time with Burns, hefound himself plagued by questions that in Cambridge, in peacetime, hemight have wanted to pursue, but which in wartime, in an overcrowdedhospital, were no use to him at all. Worse than useless, since they drainedhim of energy that rightly belonged to his patients. In a way, all this hadnothing to do with Burns. The sheer extremity of his suffering set him apartfrom the rest, but the questions were evoked by almost every case.He looked down and saw a taxi turn into the drive. Perhaps this was theerrant Captain Graves arriving at last? Yes, there was Sassoon, tooimpatient to wait indoors, running down the steps to meet him.THREEGraves, his mouth slightly open, stared up at the massive yellow-greyfa\u00e7ade of Craiglockhart. \u2018My God.\u2019Sassoon followed the direction of his gaze. \u2018That\u2019s what I thought.\u2019Graves picked up his bag and together they went up the steps, throughthe black and white tiled entrance hall on to the main corridor. Sassoonbegan to smile. \u2018Fine prisoner\u2019s escort you turned out to be.\u2019\u2018I know, I\u2019m sorry. God, what a day. Do you know, the train stopped atevery station?\u2019\u2018Well, you\u2019re here now. Thank God.\u2019Graves looked sideways at him. \u2018As bad as that?\u2019\u2018Hm. So-so.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve seen anybody yet?\u2019\u2018I\u2019ve seen Rivers. Which reminds me, he wants to see you, but I imagineit\u2019ll be all right if you dump your bag first.\u2019Graves followed Sassoon up the marble staircase to the first floor.\u2018Here we are.\u2019 Sassoon opened a door and stood aside to let Graves enter.\u2018The guest room. You\u2019ve even got a lock on your door.\u2019\u2018You haven\u2019t?\u2019\u2018No. Nor in the bathroom either.\u2019\u2018Poor old Sass, you\u2019ll just have to fight the VADs off.\u2019 Graves swung hisbag on to the nearest chair. \u2018No, seriously, what\u2019s it like?\u2019\u2018Seriously, it\u2019s awful. Come on, the sooner you\u2019ve seen Rivers the soonerwe can talk.\u2019\u2018Sassoon asked me to give you this.\u2019Rivers took the envelope without comment and placed it unopened on hisdesk. \u2018How did you find him?\u2019The net curtains breathed in the draught from the open window, and ascent of lime trees invaded the room. A sweet smell. Graves, to whom allsweet smells were terrible, wiped the sweat from his upper lip. \u2018Calmer. Ithink it\u2019s a relief to have things sorted out.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know how sorted out they are. You do realize, don\u2019t you, that hecan walk out of here at any time?\u2019\u2018He won\u2019t do that,\u2019 Graves said definitely. \u2018He\u2019ll be all right now. Aslong as the pacifists leave him alone.\u2019\u2018I had quite a long talk with him this afternoon, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019mquite clear what happened. I suspect there was a lot going on behind thescenes?\u2019Graves smiled. \u2018You could say that.\u2019\u2018What exactly?\u2019\u2018Sassoon sent me a copy of his Declaration. I was in a convalescent homeon the Isle of Wight at the time \u2013\u2019\u2018He hadn\u2019t talked to you about it?\u2019\u2018No, I haven\u2019t seen him since January. I was absolutely horrified. I couldsee at once it wouldn\u2019t do any good, nobody would follow his example.He\u2019d just destroy himself, for no reason.\u2019 He stopped. When he spokeagain, his voice was very clear and precise. \u2018Sassoon\u2019s the best platooncommander I\u2019ve ever known. The men worship him \u2013 if he wanted Germanheads on a platter they\u2019d get them. And he loves them. Being separatedfrom them would kill him. And that\u2019s exactly what a court-martial would\u2019vedone.\u2019\u2018He\u2019s separated from them here.\u2019\u2018Yes, but there\u2019s a way back. People can accept a breakdown. There\u2019s noway back from being a conchie.\u2019\u2018So you decided he \u2013\u2019\u2018Had to be stopped? Yes. I wrote to the CO, asking him to get Siegfriedanother Board. He\u2019d already skipped one. Then I contacted various people Iknow and managed to persuade them to treat it as a nervous breakdown.That left Siegfried. I knew it was no use writing. I had to see him, so I gotmyself passed fit and went back to Litherland. He was in a shocking state.He\u2019d just thrown his MC into the Mersey. Did he tell you that?\u2019Rivers hesitated. \u2018I believe it was in the Board\u2019s report.\u2019\u2018Anyway, it took a long time, but he saw sense in the end.\u2019\u2018What made him give in, do you think?\u2019\u2018He just couldn\u2019t go on denying he was ill.\u2019Rivers didn\u2019t reply. The silence deepened, like a fall of snow,accumulating second by second, flake by flake, each flake by itselfinconsiderable, until everything is transformed.\u2018No, it wasn\u2019t that.\u2019 Graves\u2019s knobbly, broken-nosed boxer\u2019s facetwitched. \u2018I lied to him.\u2019Rivers\u2019s glasses flashed as he lifted his head. \u2018Yes, I thought perhaps youhad.\u2019\u2018I swore on the Bible they wouldn\u2019t court-martial him, but I didn\u2019t knowthat. I think if he\u2019d held out, they might\u2019ve done.\u2019\u2018They might. But you know the advantages of treating this as a nervousbreakdown would have been quite apparent to the authorities, even withoutyour pointing them out.\u2019\u2018The fact remains I lied, and he gave in because he believed the lie. Hewouldn\u2019t have believed it from anybody else.\u2019 He paused. \u2018Do you think Iwas wrong?\u2019Rivers said gently, \u2018I think you did the best you could for your friend.Not the best thing for his cause, but then the cause is lost anyway. Did youfind the Board difficult to convince?\u2019\u2018Quite. There was one youngish man who was sympathetic. The othertwo \u2026 Well. I got the impression they didn\u2019t believe in shell-shock at all.As far as they were concerned, it was just cowardice. I made up my mindright from the start they weren\u2019t going to think that. I told them about lastyear when he took a German trench single-handed and got recommendedfor the VC. I\u2019d like to see them do it. And this April. You know, thatbombing expedition of his was fantastic. Everybody I\u2019ve spoken to whowas there thinks he should\u2019ve got the VC for that.\u2019 He paused. \u2018I justwanted them to know what kind of man they were dealing with.\u2019 He smiled.\u2018I kept bursting into tears. I think that helped in a way. I could see themthinking, My God, if this one\u2019s fit for duty what can the other one be like?\u2019\u2018And you told them that he had hallucinations?\u2019\u2018Yes.\u2019 Graves looked slightly uncomfortable. \u2018I had to convince them.There were a lot of things I didn\u2019t tell them. I didn\u2019t tell them he\u2019dthreatened to kill Lloyd George.\u2019\u2018And you persuaded him to say nothing?\u2019\u2018Yes. The last thing we needed was Siegfried talking sense about thewar.\u2019\u2018Sense? You mean you agree with him?\u2019\u2018Well, yes. In theory. In theory the war should stop tomorrow, but itwon\u2019t. It\u2019ll go on till there isn\u2019t a cat or a dog left to enlist.\u2019\u2018So you agree with his views, but not his actions? Isn\u2019t that rather anartificial distinction?\u2019\u2018No, I don\u2019t think it is. The way I see it, when you put the uniform on, ineffect you sign a contract. And you don\u2019t back out of a contract merelybecause you\u2019ve changed your mind. You can still speak up for yourprinciples, you can argue against the ones you\u2019re being made to fight for,but in the end you do the job. And I think that way you gain more respect.Siegfried isn\u2019t going to change people\u2019s minds like this. It may be in him tochange people\u2019s minds about the war, but this isn\u2019t the way to do it.\u2019Rivers took his clasped hands away from his mouth. \u2018I couldn\u2019t agreewith you more.\u2019\u2018What\u2019s infuriating is that basically he knows it better than anybody. He\u2019sthe one who can communicate with the ordinary soldier. It\u2019s just that he gottaken over by Bertrand Russell and Ottoline Morrell. You know, I used toadmire them. I used to think, well, I don\u2019t agree with you, but, on the otherhand, I can see it takes courage \u2026\u2019 He shook his head. \u2018Not any more. Iknow Russell\u2019s over military age, Ottoline\u2019s a woman, fair enough, neitherof them can understand what he\u2019s been through, but they could see the statehe was in, and they still went ahead. They were quite prepared to destroyhim for the sake of propagating their views. I don\u2019t forgive them for it.\u2019 Hemade a visible effort to calm down. \u2018Anyway, it\u2019s over now. But I must sayit gave me great pleasure to write to Russell and tell him Sassoon was onhis way here, and he could just bloody well leave him alone in future.\u2019\u2018And what about you?\u2019 Rivers asked, after a pause. \u2018Do you think they\u2019llsend you back?\u2019\u2018No, I don\u2019t think so. In fact, the battalion doctor told me if he ever foundmy lungs in France again, he\u2019d shoot me himself. I\u2019m hoping for Palestine.\u2019A pause. \u2018I\u2019m glad he\u2019s here. At least I can go back to Litherland knowinghe\u2019s safe.\u2019\u2018I hope he is.\u2019 Rivers stood up. \u2018And now I think I should let you getback to him. He\u2019ll need company on his first evening.\u2019After Graves had gone, Rivers sat for a while resting his eyes, thenopened the envelope Graves had",

Rivers caught and held a sigh. \u2018That does make the relationshipof doctor and patient rather difficult.\u2019Prior shrugged. Obviously he didn\u2019t think that was his problem. \u2018Youthink you know what happened, don\u2019t you?\u2019 Rivers said.\u2018I\u2019ve told you I don\u2019t remember.\u2019The antagonism was startling. They might\u2019ve been back at the beginning,when it had been almost impossible to get a civil word out of him. \u2018I\u2019msorry, I didn\u2019t make myself clear. I wasn\u2019t suggesting you knew, only thatyou might have a theory.\u2019Prior shook his head. \u2018No. No theory.\u2019A short, dark-haired man sidled round the door, blinking in the suddenblaze of sunlight. Sassoon, sitting on the bed, looked up from the golf clubhe\u2019d been cleaning. \u2018Yes?\u2019\u2018I\u2019ve b-brought these.\u2019A stammer. Not as bad as some, but bad enough. Sassoon exerted himselfto be polite. \u2018What is it? I can\u2019t see.\u2019Books. His book. Five copies, no less. \u2018My God, a reader.\u2019\u2018I wondered if you\u2019d b-be k-kind enough to s-sign them?\u2019\u2018Yes, of course.\u2019 Sassoon put the golf club down and reached for his pen.He could have dispatched the job in a few moments, but he sensed that hisvisitor wanted to talk, and he had after all bought five copies. Sassoon wascurious. \u2018Why five? Has the War Office put it on a reading list?\u2019\u2018They\u2019re f-for m-my f-family.\u2019Oh, dear. Sassoon transferred himself from bed to table and opened thefirst book. \u2018What name shall I write?\u2019\u2018Susan Owen. M-y m-mother.\u2019Sassoon began to write. Paused. \u2018Are you \u2026 quite sure your motherwants to be told that \u201cBert\u2019s gone syphilitic?\u201d I had trouble getting them toprint that.\u2019\u2018It w-won\u2019t c-come as a sh-shock.\u2019\u2018Won\u2019t it?\u2019 One could only speculate on the nature of Mrs Owen\u2019sprevious acquaintance with Bert.\u2018I t-tell her everything. In m-my l-letters.\u2019\u2018Good heavens,\u2019 Sassoon said lightly, and turned back to the book.Owen looked down at the back of Sassoon\u2019s neck, where a thin line ofkhaki was just visible beneath the purple silk of his dressing gown. \u2018Don\u2019tyou?\u2019Sassoon opened his mouth and shut it again. \u2018My brother died atGallipoli,\u2019 he said, at last. \u2018I think my mother has enough on her platewithout any searing revelations from me.\u2019\u2018I s-suppose she m-must b-be c-concerned about your b-being here.\u2019\u2018Oh, I don\u2019t think so. On the contrary. I believe the thought of myinsanity is one of her few consolations.\u2019 He glanced up, briefly. \u2018Better madthan a pacifist.\u2019 When Owen continued to look blank, he added, \u2018You doknow why I\u2019m here?\u2019\u2018Yes.\u2019\u2018And what do you think about that?\u2019\u2018I agreed with every w-word.\u2019Sassoon smiled. \u2018So did my friend Graves.\u2019 He opened the next book.\u2018Who\u2019s this one for?\u2019Owen, feeding the names, would have given anything to say one sentencewithout stammering. No hope of that \u2013 he was far too nervous. Everythingabout Sassoon intimidated him. His status as a published poet, his height,his good looks, the clipped aristocratic voice, sometimes quick, sometimeshalting, but always cold, the bored expression, the way he had of notlooking at you when you spoke \u2013 shyness, perhaps, but it seemed likearrogance. Above all, his reputation for courage. Owen had his own reasonsfor being sensitive about that.Sassoon reached the last book. Owen felt the meeting begin to slip awayfrom him. Rather desperately, he said, \u2018I l-liked \u201cThe D-Death B-Bed\u201d b-best.\u2019 And suddenly he relaxed. It didn\u2019t matter what this Sassoon thoughtabout him, since the real Sassoon was in the poems. He quoted, frommemory, \u2018 \u201cHe\u2019s young; he hated War, how should he die/When cruel oldcampaigners win safe through?/But death replied: \u2018I choose him.\u2019 So hewent.\u201d That\u2019s beautiful.\u2019Sassoon paused in his signing. \u2018Yes, I \u2013 I was quite pleased with that.\u2019\u2018Oh, and \u201cThe Redeemer\u201d. \u201cHe faced me, reeling in hisweariness,/Shouldering his load of planks, so hard to bear./I say that He wasChrist, who wrought to bless \u2026\u201d \u2019 He broke off. \u2018I\u2019ve been wanting to writethat for three years.\u2019\u2018Perhaps you should be glad you didn\u2019t.\u2019The light faded from Owen\u2019s face. \u2018Sorry?\u2019\u2018Well, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s rather easily said? \u201cI say that He was Christ\u201d?\u2019\u2018You m-mean you d-didn\u2019t m-mean it?\u2019\u2018Oh, I meant it. The book isn\u2019t putting one point of view, it\u2019s charting the\u2013 the evolution of a point of view. That\u2019s probably the first poem that evenattempts to look at the war realistically. And that one doesn\u2019t go nearly farenough.\u2019 He paused. \u2018The fact is Christ isn\u2019t on record as having lobbedmany Mills bombs.\u2019\u2018No, I s-see what you m-mean. I\u2019ve been thinking about that quite a b-bitrecently.\u2019Sassoon scarcely heard him. \u2018I got so sick of it in the end. All thoseCalvaries at crossroads just sitting there waiting to be turned into symbols. Iknew a man once, Potter his name was. You know the miraculous crucifixstories? \u201cShells falling all around, but the figure of Our Lord was spared\u201d?Well, Potter was so infuriated by them he decided to start a one-mancampaign. Whenever he saw an undamaged crucifix, he used it for targetpractice. You could hear him for miles. \u201cONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,Bastard on the Cross, FIRE!\u201d There weren\u2019t many miraculous crucifixes inPotter\u2019s section of the front.\u2019 He hesitated. \u2018But perhaps I shouldn\u2019t besaying this? I mean for all I know, you\u2019re \u2013\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know what I am. But I do know I wouldn\u2019t want a f-faith thatcouldn\u2019t face the facts.\u2019Sassoon became aware that Owen was standing at his elbow, almost likea junior officer. \u2018Why don\u2019t you sit down?\u2019 he said, waving him towards thebed. \u2018And tell me your name. I take it this one\u2019s for you?\u2019\u2018Yes. Wilfred. Wilfred Owen.\u2019Sassoon blew on his signature and closed the book. \u2018You say you\u2019ve beenthinking about it?\u2019Owen looked diffident. \u2018Yes.\u2019\u2018To any effect? I mean, did you reach any conclusions?\u2019\u2018Only that if I were going to call myself a Christian, I\u2019d have to callmyself a pacifist as well. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to c-call yourself a C-Christian and \u2026 and j-just leave out the awkward bits.\u2019\u2018You\u2019ll never make a bishop.\u2019\u2018No, well, I think I can live with that.\u2019\u2018And do you call yourself a pacifist?\u2019A long pause. \u2018No. Do you?\u2019\u2018No.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s funny, you know, I never thought about it at all in France.\u2019\u2018No, well, you don\u2019t. Too busy, too tired.\u2019 Sassoon smiled. \u2018Too healthy.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s not just that, though, is it? Sometimes when you\u2019re alone, in thetrenches, I mean, at night you get the sense of something ancient. As if thetrenches had always been there. You know one trench we held, it had skullsin the side. You looked back along and \u2026 Like mushrooms. And do youknow, it was actually easier to believe they were men from Marlborough\u2019sarmy than to to to think they\u2019d been alive two years ago. It\u2019s as if all otherwars had somehow \u2026 distilled themselves into this war, and that makes itsomething you \u2026 almost can\u2019t challenge. It\u2019s like a very deep voice saying,Run along, little man. Be thankful if you survive.\u2019For a moment the nape of Sassoon\u2019s neck crawled as it had the first timeCampbell talked about German spies; but this was not madness. \u2018I had asimilar experience. Well, I don\u2019t know whether it is similar. I was going upwith the rations one night and I saw the limbers against the skyline, and theflares going up. What you see every night. Only I seemed to be seeing itfrom the future. A hundred years from now they\u2019ll still be ploughing upskulls. And I seemed to be in that time and looking back. I think I saw ourghosts.\u2019Silence. They\u2019d gone further than either of them had intended, and for amoment they didn\u2019t know how to get back. Gradually, they stirred, theylooked round, at sunlight streaming over beds and chairs, at Sassoon\u2019s razorglinting on the washstand, its handle smeared with soap. Sassoon looked athis watch. \u2018I\u2019m going to be late for golf.\u2019Immediately Owen stood up. \u2018Well, thanks for these,\u2019 he said, taking thebooks. He laughed. \u2018Thanks for writing it.\u2019Sassoon followed him to the door. \u2018Did you say you wrote?\u2019\u2018I didn\u2019t, but I do.\u2019\u2018Poetry?\u2019\u2018Yes. Nothing in print yet. Oh, which reminds me. I\u2019m editor of theHydra. The hospital magazine? I was wondering if you could let us havesomething. It needn\u2019t be \u2013\u2019\u2018Yes, I\u2019ll look something out.\u2019 Sassoon opened the door. \u2018Give me a fewdays. You could bring your poems.\u2019This was said with such determined courtesy and such transparent lack ofenthusiasm that Owen burst out laughing. \u2018No, I \u2013\u2019\u2018No, I mean it.\u2019\u2018All right.\u2019 Owen was still laughing. \u2018They are quite short.\u2019\u2018No, well, it doesn\u2019t lend itself to epics, does it?\u2019\u2018Oh, they\u2019re not about the war.\u2019 He hesitated. \u2018I don\u2019t write about that.\u2019\u2018Why ever not?\u2019\u2018I s-suppose I\u2019ve always thought of p-poetry as the opposite of all that.The ugliness.\u2019 Owen was struggling to articulate a point of view he wasabandoning even as he spoke. \u2018S-Something to to t-take refuge in.\u2019Sassoon nodded. \u2018Fair enough.\u2019 He added mischievously, \u2018Though itdoes seem a bit like having a faith that daren\u2019t face the facts.\u2019 He sawOwen\u2019s expression change. \u2018Look, it doesn\u2019t matter what they\u2019re about.Bring them anyway.\u2019\u2018Yes, I will. Thank you.\u2019Anderson, following Sassoon into the bar of the golf club, knew he owedhim an apology. At the seventeenth hole, afraid he was losing, he\u2019d misseda vital shot and in the heat of the moment had not merely sworn at Sassoon,but actually raised the club and threatened to hit him with it. Sassoon hadlooked startled, even alarmed, but he\u2019d laughed it off. At the eighteenthhole, he\u2019d been careful to ask Anderson\u2019s advice about which iron heshould use. Now, he turned to Anderson and said, \u2018Usual?\u2019Anderson nodded. The trouble was, Anderson thought, it looked so muchlike bad sportsmanship, whereas in reality the apology was being delayed,not by any unwillingness on his part to admit he was wrong, but by theextent of the horror he felt at his own behaviour. He\u2019d behaved like a spoiltchild. So do something about it, he told himself. \u2018Sorry about that,\u2019 he said,nodding towards the course.\u2018\u2019S all right.\u2019 Sassoon turned from the bar and smiled. \u2018We all have baddays.\u2019\u2018Here\u2019s your half-crown.\u2019Sassoon grinned and pocketed it. He was thinking, as he turned back tothe bar, that if the club had landed on his head he would have been far moreseriously injured than he\u2019d been at Arras. He conjured Rivers up in hismind and asked, What was that you were saying about \u2018safety\u2019? Nothingmore dangerous than playing golf with lunatics. \u2018Lunatic\u2019 was a wordSassoon would never have dared use to Rivers\u2019s face, so it gave him anadditional pleasure to yell it at his image.They took their drinks, found a quiet corner, and began their usualinquest on the game. Under cover of the familiar chat, Anderson watchedSassoon \u2013 a good-looking, rather blank face, big hands curved round hisglass \u2013 and. thought how little he knew about him. Or wanted to know. Itwas a matter of tacit agreement that they talked about nothing but golf.Anderson had read the Declaration, but he wouldn\u2019t have dreamt ofdiscussing Sassoon\u2019s attitude to the war, mainly because some return ofintimacy would then have been required. He might have had to disclose hisown reasons for being at Craiglockhart. His horror of blood. He had amomentary picture of the way Sassoon\u2019s head would have looked if he\u2019d hithim, and his hand tightened on the glass. \u2018You\u2019re still not taking your time,\u2019he said. \u2018You\u2019re rushing your shots.\u2019There were other reasons too why he didn\u2019t want to talk about the war.Inevitably such talk would have strengthened his own doubts, and theywere bad enough already. He even dreamt about the bloody war, not justnightmares, he was used to those; he\u2019d dreamt he was speaking at a debateon whether it should go on or not. In his dream he\u2019d spoken in favour ofcontinuing to the point of German collapse, but Rivers\u2019s analysis had lefthim in no doubt as to how far his horror at the whole business went. He feltsafe with Rivers, because he knew Rivers shared the horror, and shared toothe conviction that, in spite of everything, it had to go on.\u2018I don\u2019t know whether to spend that half-crown or frame it,\u2019 Sassoon wassaying. \u2018I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019ll ever win another.\u2019That was to make Anderson feel better about losing his temper on thecourse. Sassoon was a pleasant companion, there was no doubt about that.He was friendly, modest. But the Declaration hadn\u2019t been modest. What hadchiefly struck Anderson about that was its arrogance, its totally outrageousassumption that everybody who disagreed with him was \u2018callous\u2019. Do youthink I\u2019m callous? he wanted to ask. Do you think Rivers is callous? Butthere was no point getting worked up. Rivers would soon sort him out.\u2018I shan\u2019t be seeing you tomorrow, shall I?\u2019 Sassoon was saying. \u2018Yourwife\u2019s coming up.\u2019\u2018No, I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s had to cancel. So it\u2019s business as usual.\u2019 He tookSassoon\u2019s empty glass and stood up. \u2018You can try to make it five bob, if youlike.\u2019Prior watched the amber lights winking in his beer. He was sitting in theshadowy corner of a pub in some sleazy district of Edinburgh. He didn\u2019tknow where he was. He\u2019d walked miles that evening, not admitting even tohimself what he was looking for, and gradually the winding, insidiousstreets had led him deeper and deeper into a neighbourhood where washinghung, grey-white, from stacked balconies, and the smell of steak fryingreminded him of home.Remembering the smell, his stomach rumbled. He\u2019d had nothing to eatall evening, except a packet of peanuts. Crumbs of salt still clung to his lips,stinging the cracks where the skin had dried during his asthma attack. It wasworth it, though, just to sit quietly, to listen to voices that didn\u2019t stammer, tohave his eyes freed from the ache of khaki.No theory. He\u2019d lied to Rivers about that. It was a point of honour withhim to lie to Rivers at least once during every meeting. He drained his glassand went out into the night.A little way down the street was a caf\u00e9. He\u2019d passed it on his way to thepub and been tempted to go in, but the door had opened and the breath ofhot, damp, dirty, dishwater-smelling air had decided him against it. Now,though, he was too hungry to care. He went in, noticing how the innerwindows dripped from condensation, how the damp air insinuated itself intothe spaces between his uniform and his skin. A short silence fell. Nobody inan officer\u2019s uniform was likely to be inconspicuous or welcome here. Hewould eat something, fish and chips, quickly and then go.A group of women was sitting at the next table. Three of them wereyoung, one older, thirty-five, forty perhaps, with blackened stumps forteeth. As far as he could make out from the conversation her name wasLizzie, and the others were Madge, the blonde, pretty one, Betty, who wasdark and thin, and Sarah, who had her back to him. Since they all had aslightly yellow tinge to their skin, he assumed they were munitions workers.Munitionettes, as the newspapers liked to call them. Lizzie was keeping theyounger girls entertained with a string of stories.\u2018There\u2019s this lass and she\u2019s a bit simple and she lived next door to a pro \u2013well you know what a pro is.\u2019 Lizzie glanced at him and lowered her voice.\u2018So she\u2019s standing at the door this day, and the pro\u2019s coming up the street,you know, dressed to death. So she says, \u201cEeh,\u201d she says, \u201cyou\u2019re alwayslovely dressed.\u201d She says, \u201cYou\u2019ve got beautiful clothes.\u201d And she says, \u201cIlove your hats.\u201d So the pro says, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you get yourself downthe town like I do?\u201d She says, \u201cIf a man winks at you, wink back and gowith him and let him have what he wants and charge him 7/6. And go toR&K Modes and get yourself a hat.\u201d So the next day the pro\u2019s coming upthe street again. \u201cHello.\u201d \u201cHello.\u201d She says, \u201cD\u2019 y\u2019 get a hat?\u201d She says,\u201cNah.\u201d \u201cWell, did you not do as I telled you?\u201d She says, \u201cWhy of course Idid.\u201d She says, \u201cI went down the town and there was a man winked at usand I winked back. He says, \u2018Howay over the Moor.\u2019 \u201d So she says, \u201cI gansover the Moor with him,\u201d she says, \u201cand I let him have what he wanted. Hesays, \u2018How much is that?\u2019 I says, \u20187/6.\u2019 He says, \u2018Hadaway and shite,\u2019 andwhen I come back he\u2019d gone.\u201d \u2019The girls shrieked with laughter. He looked at them again. The one calledMadge was very pretty, but there was no hope of winkling her out of thegroup, and he thought he might as well be moving on. As soon as his mealarrived, he began stuffing limp chips and thickly battered fish into hismouth, wiping the grease away on the back of his hand.\u2018You\u2019ll get hiccups.\u2019He looked up. It was Sarah, the one who\u2019d been sitting with her back tohim. \u2018You\u2019ll have to give us a surprise, then, won\u2019t you?\u2019\u2018Drop me key down your back if you like.\u2019\u2018That\u2019s nose bleeds, Sarah,\u2019 Betty said.\u2018She knows what it is,\u2019 said Lizzie.Madge said, \u2018Hiccups, you\u2019re supposed to drink from the other side ofthe cup.\u2019She and Prior stared at each other across the table.\u2018But it\u2019s a con, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 he said. \u2018You can\u2019t do it.\u2019\u2018 \u2019Course you can.\u2019\u2018Go on, then, let\u2019s see you.\u2019She dipped her small, straight nose into her cup, lapped, spluttered andcame up laughing and wiping her chin. Betty, obviously jealous, gave her adig in the ribs. \u2018Hey up you, you\u2019re gonna gerrus slung out.\u2019The caf\u00e9 owner was eyeing them from behind the till, slowly polishing aglass on a distinctly grubby-looking tea towel. The girls went back to theirtea, bursting into minor explosions of giggles, their shoulders shaking,while Prior turned back and finished his meal. He was aware of Sarahbeside him. She had very heavy, very thick, dark-brown hair, but all overthe surface, in a kind of halo, were other hairs, auburn, copper, chestnut.He\u2019d never seen hair like that before. He looked at her, and she turnedaround and stared at him, a cool, amused stare from greenish eyes. He said,\u2018Would you like a drink?\u2019She looked at her cup.\u2018No, I meant a proper drink.\u2019\u2018Pubs round here don\u2019t let women in.\u2019\u2018Isn\u2019t there a hotel?\u2019\u2018Well, there\u2019s the Cumberland, but \u2026\u2019The other women looked at each other. Lizzie said, \u2018Howay, lasses, Ithink our Sarah\u2019s clicked.\u2019The three of them got up, said a good-natured \u2018goodnight\u2019 and trippedout of the caf\u00e9, only bursting into giggles again after they\u2019d reached thepavement.\u2018Shall we go, then?\u2019 said Prior.Sarah looked at him. \u2018Aye, all right.\u2019Outside, she turned to him. \u2018I still don\u2019t know your name.\u2019\u2018Prior,\u2019 he said automatically.She burst out laughing. \u2018Don\u2019t you lot have Christian names?\u2019\u2018Billy.\u2019 He wanted to say, and I\u2019m not \u2018you lot\u2019.\u2018Mine\u2019s Sarah. Sarah Lumb.\u2019 She held out her hand to him in a direct,almost boyish way. It intrigued him, since nothing else about her wasboyish.\u2018Well, Sarah Lumb, lead on.\u2019Her preferred drink was port and lemon. Prior was startled at the rate sheknocked them back. A flush spread across her cheeks in a different placefrom the rouge, so that she looked as if her face had slid out of focus. Sheworked in a factory, she said, making detonators. Twelve-hour shifts, sixdays a week, but she liked the work, she said, and it was well paid. \u2018Fiftybob a week.\u2019\u2018I suppose that\u2019s something.\u2019\u2018Too bloody right it is. I was earning ten bob before the war.\u2019He thought what the detonators she made could do to flesh and bone, andhis mind bulged as a memory threatened to surface. \u2018You\u2019re",

      "chapter_text": "France notknowing how to load a rifle. He saw them now, his little band, sitting onbales of straw in a sun-chinked barn, while he knelt to inspect their raw andblistered feet, and wondered how many of them were still alive.The windows banged and rattled, and again, in a brief lull, he thought heheard tapping. There were no trees close enough to touch the glass. Hesupposed there might be rats, but then whoever heard of rats tapping? Hetossed and turned, thinking how stupid it was not to be able to sleep here, insafety and comfort, when in France he\u2019d been able to sleep anywhere. If hecould sleep on a firestep in drenching rain, surely he could sleep now \u2026He woke to find Orme standing immediately inside the door. He wasn\u2019tsurprised, he assumed Orme had come to rouse him for his watch. What didsurprise him, a little, was that he seemed to be in bed. Orme was wearingthat very pale coat of his. Once, in \u2018C\u2019 company mess, the CO had said,\u2018Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, Orme, but I have always assumed that the colourof the British Army uniform is khaki. Not \u2026 beige.\u2019 \u2018Beige\u2019 was said insuch Lady Bracknellish tones that Sassoon had wanted to laugh. He wantedto laugh now, but his chest muscles didn\u2019t seem to work. After a while heremembered that Orme was dead.This clearly didn\u2019t worry Orme, who continued to stand quietly by thedoor, but Sassoon began to think it ought to worry him. Perhaps if he turnedhis head it would be all right. He stared at the window\u2019s pale square of light,and when he looked back Orme had gone.Fothersgill was awake. \u2018Did you see anybody come in?\u2019 Sassoon asked.\u2018No, nobody\u2019s been in.\u2019 He turned over and within a few minutes wassnoring again.Sassoon waited for the rhythm to be firmly established, then got out ofbed and walked across to the window. The storm had blown itself out,though twigs, leaves and even one or two larger branches, scattered acrossthe tennis courts, bore witness to its power. The palms of his hands weresweating and his mouth was dry.He needed to talk to Rivers, though he\u2019d have to be careful what he said,since Rivers was a thorough-going rationalist who wouldn\u2019t take kindly totales of the supernatural, and might even decide the symptoms of a warneurosis were manifesting themselves at last. Perhaps they were. Perhapsthis was the kind of hallucination he\u2019d had in the 4th London, but no, hedidn\u2019t believe that. His nocturnal visitors there had come trailing gore,pointing to amputations and head wounds, rather like the statues ofmedieval saints pointing to the instruments of their martyrdom. This hadbeen so restrained. Dignified. And it hadn\u2019t followed on from a nightmareeither. He thought back, wanting to be sure, because he knew this was thefirst question Rivers would ask. No, no nightmare. Only that tapping at thewindow before he went to sleep.He got dressed and sat on the bed. At last eight o\u2019clock came, and thehospital became noisy as the shifts changed. Sassoon ran downstairs. Hefelt certain Rivers would go to his office to check the post before he left,and there might just be time for a few words. But when he tapped on thedoor, a passing orderly said, \u2018Captain Rivers\u2019s gone, sir. He left on the sixo\u2019clock train.\u2019So that was that. Sassoon went slowly upstairs, unable to account for hissense of loss. After all, he\u2019d known Rivers was going. And he was onlygoing for three weeks. Fothersgill was still asleep. Sassoon collected hiswashbag and went along to the bathroom. He felt almost dazed. As usual heturned to lock the door, and as usual remembered there were no locks. Attimes like this the lack of privacy was almost intolerable. He filled thebasin, and splashed his face and neck. Birds, sounding a little stunned as ifthey too needed to recover from the night, were beginning, cautiously, tosing. He looked at his face in the glass. In this half-light, against white tiles,it looked scarcely less ghostly than Orme\u2019s. A memory tweaked the edgesof his mind. Another glass, on the top landing at home, a dark, oval mirrorframing the face of a small, pale child. Himself. Five years old, perhaps.Now why did he remember that? Birds had been singing, then, too.Sparrows, twittering in the ivy. A day of shouts and banged doors and tearsin rooms he was not allowed to enter. The day his father left home. Or theday he died? No, the day he left. Sassoon smiled, amused at the link he\u2019ddiscovered, and then stopped smiling. He\u2019d joked once or twice to Riversabout his being his father confessor, but only now, faced with this secondabandonment, did he realize how completely Rivers had come to take hisfather\u2019s place. Well, that didn\u2019t matter, did it? After all, if it came tosubstitute fathers, he might do a lot worse. No, it was all right. Slowly, helathered his face and began to shave.Part Three FOURTEEN\u2018Hymn No. 373.\u2019With a rustling of paper the maroon-backed hymn books blossomed intowhite. The congregation struggled to its feet. Children at the front under thewatchful eye of Sunday-school teachers, the rest, middle-aged or elderlymen, and women. A preliminary wheeze from the organ, then:God moves in a mysterious wayHis wonders to perform \u2026Since the Somme, this seemed to have become the nation\u2019s most popularhymn. Rivers had lost count of the number of times he\u2019d heard it sung. Helifted his eyes to the flag-draped altar, and then to the east window. Acrucifixion. The Virgin and St John on either side, the Holy Ghostdescending, God the Father beaming benignly down. Beneath it, and muchsmaller, Abraham\u2019s sacrifice of his son. Behind Abraham was the ramcaught in a thicket by his horns and struggling to escape, by far the bestthing in the window. You could see the fear. Whereas Abraham, if heregretted having to sacrifice his son at all, was certainly hiding it well andIsaac, bound on a makeshift altar, positively smirked.Obvious choices for the east window: the two bloody bargains on whicha civilization claims to be based. The bargain, Rivers thought, looking atAbraham and Isaac. The one on which all patriarchal societies are founded.If you, who are young and strong, will obey me, who am old and weak,even to the extent of being prepared to sacrifice your life, then in the courseof time you will peacefully inherit, and be able to exact the same obediencefrom your sons. Only we\u2019re breaking the bargain, Rivers thought. All overnorthern France, at this very moment, in trenches and dugouts and floodedshell-holes, the inheritors were dying, not one by one, while old men, andwomen of all ages, gathered together and sang hymns.Blind unbelief is sure to err,And scan His works in vain;He is His own interpreterAnd He will make it plain. Amen.The congregation, having renounced reason, looked rather the happier forit, and sat down to await the sermon. Charles leant towards Rivers andwhispered, \u2018He doesn\u2019t usually go on very long.\u2019That whisper brought back the Sunday mornings of their childhood whenthey\u2019d drive to church in a pony and trap, and spent the sermon looking upthe naughty bits in the Old Testament, a task made easier by the grubbyfingerprints of those who had gone before. He remembered Michal\u2019s bride-price: an hundred foreskins of the Philistines. As an anthropologist, he stillfound that fascinating. He remembered the smell of hassocks, and fastenedhis eyes on the flag-draped altar. They would never come back, those times.The vicar had reached the top of the pulpit steps. A faint light flashed onhis glasses as he made the sign of the cross. \u2018In the name of the Father andof the Son and of the Holy Ghost \u2026\u2019Charles was busy with a great rehousing of the hens. They were to betransferred from deep litter in the barn to the new coops in Two-acre Field.This was best done after dusk when the hens were drowsy and less likely torebel. The brothers lingered over tea in the living room, and then went outacross the black, sodden, dismal mud of the yard towards the large, lowbarn. Rivers was wearing a pair of old cord breeches kept up with one of hisbrother\u2019s belts, visible proof that Bertha\u2019s strictures on his loss of weightwere justified. \u2018It isn\u2019t as if,\u2019 she said at every mealtime, piling his platehigh, \u2018you had it to lose.\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s all right, Bertha, leave him alone,\u2019 Charlesalways said, though it made no difference. Rivers still staggered away fromthe table feeling that he\u2019d been force-fed.Charles carried the hens easily, his arms binding the wings fast to hissides. Rivers, less expert, picked up two birds and set off after him. Hisfingers dug through the fluffiness into the surprisingly hard quills, andtouched clammy flesh. The blood-red combs jiggled as he walked, ambereyes looked up with a kind of bright vacuity. As he tried to nudge thefarmyard gate open with his elbow, one of them got its wings free andflapped frantically until he managed to subdue it again. God, I hate hens, hethought.The chicken farm had been his idea, after Charles came back from theEast with malaria. Work in the open air, Rivers had advised. He was payingfor it now. As he left the shelter of the hedge and set off across Two-acreField, a great gust of \u2018open air\u2019 almost lifted him off his feet. He feltresponsible for the farm idea, and it wasn\u2019t paying. At the moment theywere only just breaking even. Mainly it was the effect of the war. Feed wasscarce and expensive, male help impossible to get. The last land girl hadstayed only long enough to work out the distance to the nearest town,before discovering that some domestic crisis required her immediate returnhome. But even without the war it might not have been easy. Hens had acurious way of not thriving. They seemed to be subject to a trulyphenomenal range of diseases and to take a perverse pleasure in workingtheir way down the list.It was almost completely dark now, a few faint stars pricking through theclear sky. One hen, weaker than the rest, was being picked on by the others.Its chest was bare of feathers and raw where they\u2019d pecked at it.\u2018I\u2019ll have to get that one out and wring its neck,\u2019 Charles said.\u2018Can\u2019t you just isolate her and then put her back in?\u2019\u2018No. Once they start they never stop.\u2019They turned and walked back. McTavish, the farm cat, a black, batteredtorn, met them at the corner of the yard and preceded them across it. Anotably morose cat, McTavish, a defect of temperament Rivers attributed tohis being perpetually surrounded by forbidden flesh. He was fond ofMcTavish and slipped him titbits from his plate whenever he thought Berthawasn\u2019t looking.They moved hens for an hour; slow, tedious work and then, as realdarkness set in, went back to the house. Bertha had been baking. Anearthenware pot full of bread dough stood by the kitchen range, and thewhole firelit room was full of the smell of warm yeast. \u2018You\u2019ll be all right,won\u2019t you?\u2019 Bertha said, driving a hat pin neatly into her hat, and craningtowards the mirror to make sure it was on straight. She and Charles wereusing Rivers as a chicken-sitter while they enjoyed a rare night out.\u2018Don\u2019t fuss, Bertha,\u2019 Charles said.\u2018There\u2019s two loaves in the oven. They\u2019ll be done at ten past eight. Turnthem out, tap the base. If it sounds hollow, they\u2019re done. Do you think youcan manage that?\u2019\u2018He\u2019s not a complete idiot, Bertha,\u2019 Charles called in from the hall.Bertha looked doubtful. \u2018All right, then. Are we off?\u2019Charles came in wearing his hat and coat.Rivers said, \u2018I\u2019ll see if I can get those accounts finished, Charles.\u2019\u2018I wish you would,\u2019 Bertha murmured as she went past.Once they\u2019d gone, Rivers sat in the rocking chair by the fire, andconcentrated on not dozing off. He hadn\u2019t dared not eat at dinner, and theunaccustomed heavy meal and the firelight were making his eyelids droop.Last spring when he\u2019d been here, boxes of chicks had been put to warmbefore the fire, and then the room had been full of the pecking andscratching of tiny beaks and feet. He remembered them struggling out of theeggs, how exhausted, wet and miserable they looked, and yet curiouslypowerful, little Atlases struggling to hold up the world. Now the samechicks were scruffy, bedraggled things running in the coops, and the onlysound in the room was the roar of flame.He stretched out his legs and looked at the account book on the edge ofthe kitchen table. He had letters he ought to write, the most urgent beingone to David Burns, who\u2019d invited him to spend the last few days of hisleave at the family\u2019s holiday cottage on the Suffolk coast. As far as Riverscould make out, Burns\u2019s parents wanted to talk about his future, andalthough Rivers was not particularly anxious to do this \u2013 he found itdifficult to envisage any future for Burns \u2013 he thought it his duty to accept.And then there was a half-completed letter to Sassoon, but the accountswould have to come first. Ten past eight. He got the loaves from the oven,tipped them out, and tapped the bases. Since he\u2019d never done this before, hehad no way of knowing whether this particular sound was \u2018hollow\u2019 or not.He decided they looked done, and set them to cool on the tray. Then hefetched the shoe box in which Charles stored his receipts and set to work onfinishing the accounts. At intervals as he worked he looked up. The windwhich had been blowing a gale all day was beginning to die down. Once heheard an owl hoot from the copse at the other side of Two-acre Field, acold, shivery sound that made him glad of the fire and the smell of warmbread.When he\u2019d finished, he took the oil lamp and went along to the frontroom, intending to have another go at finishing his letter to Siegfried. Heput the lamp down on the desk. Ranged at intervals around the walls, bigheavy pieces of furniture squatted on their own shadows. Most of them heremembered from his childhood home: Knowles Bank. They were too bigto fit into his sisters\u2019 cottage, he had no need of them, and so Charles andBertha had inherited them all. Their presence here in different places, atdifferent angles to the walls and to each other, gave him an odd feeling ofslipping back into an out-of-focus version of his childhood.A cold, unused room. All the farm paperwork was done in the kitchen.He decided to take his letter along and finish it there, but then lingered,fingering the leather of the desk top and looking at the picture that hungabove the empty grate. At Knowles Bank it had hung in the same position,above the fireplace, in his father\u2019s study. As a picture it could hardly havebeen more appropriate to his father\u2019s dual role as priest and speechtherapist, since it showed the Apostles at Pentecost immediately after theyhad received the gift of tongues. There they sat, each under his ownpersonal flame, rendered in an instant fluent, persuasive and articulate, notmerely in their own language but in all known tongues. Rivers rememberedthe bishop\u2019s sermon one Pentecost when he\u2019d explained that the gift oftongues as bestowed upon the Apostles had absolutely nothing to do with\u2018the gift of tongues\u2019 as bestowed regularly every Sunday on uneducatedriff-raff in various tin-roofed chapels about the diocese. The gift ofPentecost had made the Apostles comprehensible in all known languages.And there they sat still, looking, Rivers couldn\u2019t help thinking, mostunchristianly smug about it all.He\u2019d sat with other boys \u2013 his father\u2019s pupils \u2013 underneath that picturefor many a long hour, stumbling over the consonants of his own language,remembering to hold down the back of his tongue, project his breath in aneven flow, etc., etc. Sometimes his father would walk with him up anddown the room, since he believed the measured pace helped to regulate theflow of breath. Rivers hadn\u2019t been the star pupil in those classes, not by anymeans. If anything he\u2019d made rather less progress than the rest, in spite of \u2013or because of? \u2013 having his teacher with him all the time. The house wasfull of stammering boys, any age from ten to nineteen, and at least it meanthe was not the only one. It had had another advantage too, he remembered.While the boys were there, the Reverend Charles Dodgson stayed away. MrDodgson didn\u2019t like boys. As soon as they left at Christmas or in thesummer holidays, he arrived, taking lessons every evening after dinner.Rivers, from long exposure to other people\u2019s speech impediments, couldsum up the main features of a stammer almost as quickly as his father.Dodgson found m difficult, and p in consonant combinations, particularly inthe middle of words, but his arch enemy was hard c.During the day there were boating trips on the river. Dodgson and thefour Rivers children, himself, Charles, Ethel and \u2013 Dodgson\u2019s favourite \u2013Katharine. He\u2019d never enjoyed those trips much, and neither, he thought,had Charles, though probably that was no more than the slight pique of twoVictorian schoolboys, finding themselves, for the first time in their lives,not of the preferred sex. Afterwards, during those apparently endlesssummer evenings, there would be croquet on the lawn, Rivers\u2019s father andDodgson playing, the children watching. There was a photograph of themon the desk, doing just that, he and Charles leaning back against the gardenroller, no doubt getting grass stains on their white shirts, the two little girls,his sisters, under the shade of the beech tree. If he tried hard, he could recallthe feel of the roller against his shoulder blades, the heat of the sun on theback of his neck.He had one other memory of Dodgson. One evening he\u2019d crept close tothe open window of his father\u2019s study, sat down with his back to the walland listened to the lesson in progress. Why he\u2019d done this he couldn\u2019t nowremember, except that it hadn\u2019t felt like eavesdropping, since he knewnothing private was likely to be said. Perhaps he\u2019d just wanted to hearDodgson put through the same routine he and the other boys were putthrough. Perhaps he\u2019d wanted to see him cut down to size. Dodgson hadjust embarked on the sentence about the careful cat catching the mouse \u2013 asimple enough tale, but already, in Dodgson\u2019s mouth, threatening to becomean epic. Rivers listened to his father\u2019s advice, the same advice, basically,that he got, though conveyed without that peculiar note of fraught patience.He thought suddenly, this is nonsense. It doesn\u2019t help to remember to keepyour tongue down, it doesn\u2019t help to think about the flow of breath. So he\u2019dthought, sweeping away his father\u2019s life work in a single minute as twelve-year-old boys are apt to do. He\u2019d raised his head very cautiously above thewindow sill, and seen his father sitting behind the desk \u2013 this desk \u2013 hisback to the window, clean pink neck showing above clean white collar,broad shoulders straining the cloth of his jacket. He stared at the back of hisneck, at the neck of the man whom he had, in a way, just killed, and hedidn\u2019t feel sad or guilty about it at all. He felt glad.Later that summer he\u2019d given a talk to the speech therapy group onmonkeys. M was to him what c was to Dodgson, but he was interested inmonkeys, and still more interested in Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, whichby this time had achieved acceptance in some circles. Knowles Bank wasnot among them. His father had been furious, not because Rivers hadstumbled over every single m without exception \u2013 though indeed he had \u2013but because he\u2019d dared suggest that Genesis was no more than the creationmyth of a Bronze Age people. Dinner that night was a strained occasion.Father angry, mother upset, Charles covertly sympathetic, sisters goggle-eyed and making the most of it, Rivers",

Three weeks?\u2019\u2018I\u2019ll think about it.\u2019\u2018Good. And don\u2019t be too altruistic, will you? You\u2019re isolated up there, it\u2019snot good for you.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know about isolated. I never have a minute to myself.\u2019\u2018Precisely. Come on, let\u2019s find Ruth.\u2019FIFTEENAldeburgh was the end of the line, but. the train, as if reluctant to acceptthis, produced, as Rivers stepped down on to the platform, an amazing burstof steam. He stood, looking up and down, as the train\u2019s hissing subsidedinto grunts, and the steam cleared. Burns had promised to meet him, but hismemory wasn\u2019t good, and, faced with the empty platform, Rivers was gladhe had the address. But then, just as Rivers was resigning himself to findingthe house on his own, Burns appeared, a tall, emaciated figure wearing acoat of stiff herringbone tweed that reached almost to the ground. He\u2019dobviously been running, and was out of breath. \u2018Hello,\u2019 he said. Rivers triedto judge whether Burns looked better or worse. It was hard to tell. His facein the light of the naphtha flares was as expressionless as beaten bronze.\u2018How are you?\u2019 they asked simultaneously, and then laughed.Rivers decided he should be the one to answer. \u2018A lot better, thanks.\u2019\u2018Good,\u2019 Burns said. \u2018It\u2019s walking distance,\u2019 he added across his shoulder,already striding off. \u2018We don\u2019t need a taxi.\u2019They came out of the station and began walking downhill, through thequiet cold fringes of the town, past the church, through streets of huddledhouses, and out on to the front.The sea was calm, almost inaudible, a toothless mouth mumbling pebblesin the darkness. Instead of walking along the path, Burns struck out acrossthe shingle and Rivers followed, to where the tide had laid bare a thin stripof sand. The crunch and slither of shingle under their feet blotted out allother sounds. Rivers turned, and saw the bones of Burns\u2019s face gleaming inthe moonlight. He wondered what he made of the tangles of barbed wirethat ran along the beach, with only two narrow channels left for fishingboats and for the lifeboat to come and go. But Burns seemed not to see thewire.They stood together at the water\u2019s edge, two black shadows on the paleshingle, and small waves creamed over at their feet. Then the moon cameout from behind a bank of dark cloud, and the fishermen\u2019s huts, the boatslined up in two short rows behind the wire, and the heaped nets, castshadows behind them almost as sharply edged as day.They returned to the path and began walking along the terrace of houses,which here and there had gaps. Many of the houses were shuttered and hadsandbags piled against the front doors. \u2018The sea\u2019s been known to pay visits,\u2019Burns said, following the direction of Rivers\u2019s gaze. \u2018I was here once whenit flooded.\u2019 Evidently sandbags brought back no other memories.\u2018This is it,\u2019 he said a few minutes later, stopping in front of a tall butextremely narrow house. At this end of the foreshore the sea was muchcloser, turning and turning in the darkness. Rivers looked out and caught aglint of white. \u2018What\u2019s along there?\u2019\u2018The marshes. More shingle. I\u2019ll show you tomorrow.\u2019They groped their way into the hall, closing the door carefully behindthem before Burns switched on the light. His face, deeply shadowed fromthe unshaded bulb, peered anxiously at Rivers. \u2018I expect you\u2019d like to goupstairs,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think I\u2019ve given you a towel \u2026\u2019 He looked like a childtrying to remember what it was that grown-ups said to newly arrived guests.He also looked, for the first time, deranged.Rivers followed him up the narrow stairs and into a small bedroom.Burns pointed out the bathroom and then went downstairs. Rivers put hisbag down, bounced on the bed to test the mattress, and looked round. Thewalls were covered with paper of an indeterminate and confusing pattern,the background colour faded to the yellow of an old bruise. Everythingsmelled of the sea, as if the furniture had soaked it in. It reminded him ofchildhood holidays in Brighton. He splashed his face in the bowl, then,turning off the light, opened the shutters. His room overlooked the sea. Thewind was rising, and with each gust the coils of wire twitched as if theywere alive.No sign of Burns\u2019s parents. Rivers had mistakenly assumed he was beinginvited to meet them, since a large part of Burns\u2019s letter had dealt with theiranxieties about his future. But apparently not. This was probably theirroom. The house was so narrow there couldn\u2019t be more than one, or at themost, two small rooms on each floor.The evening passed pleasantly enough. No mention of Burns\u2019s illness, nomention of the war. These were evidently taboo topics, but they talkedabout a great range of other things. Whatever else the war had done toBurns, it had certainly deepened his love for his native county. Suffolkflowers, birds, churches, he was knowledgeable about them all. Morerecently, he\u2019d become interested in the preservation of country crafts. \u2018OldClegg\u2019, who was apparently something of a local character, had promised toteach him flint-knapping, and he seemed to be looking forward to that.Even before the war he\u2019d been very much a countryman in his interests,rather like Siegfried in a way, though without Siegfried\u2019s passion forhunting.When the conversation turned to other matters, Burns was very much thebright sixth former, idealistic, intolerant, na\u00efve, inclined to offer sweepinggeneralizations as fact, attractive in the freshness of his vision as such boysoften are. Rivers thought how misleading it was to say that the war had\u2018matured\u2019 these young men. It wasn\u2019t true of his patients, and it certainlywasn\u2019t true of Burns, in whom a prematurely aged man and a fossilizedschoolboy seemed to exist side by side. It did give him a curiously agelessquality, but \u2018maturity\u2019 was hardly the word. Still, he was better than he\u2019dbeen at Craiglockhart, so perhaps his conviction that if he could only getback to Suffolk and forget the war he would be all right had been provedcorrect. But then why am I here? Rivers thought. Despite Burns\u2019s reluctanceto mention his illness, Rivers didn\u2019t believe he\u2019d been invited to Suffolk totalk about church architecture. But it would be quite wrong to force thepace. Whatever was bothering him, he would raise the matter in his owntime.Rivers woke the following morning to find the beach shrouded in mist. Heleant on the window sill, and watched the fishing boats return. The pebbleson the beach were wet, though not from rain or tide. The mist clung to themlike sweat, and the air tasted of iron. Everything was so quiet. When a gullflew in from the sea and passed immediately overhead, he heard the creakof its wings.Burns was already up, in the kitchen by the sound of things, but not,Rivers thought, preparing breakfast. Nothing in the way of dinner or supperhad appeared the night before, and Rivers had hesitated, on his firstevening, to go into the kitchen and forage for food, though he suspected thatmight be the only way of getting any.He washed, dressed, shaved, and went downstairs. By this time the miston the beach had begun to thin, but it was cold for the time of year, and thesight of a fire in the first floor living room was welcome. He went down afurther flight of stairs into the kitchen and found Burns at the kitchen tablewith a pot of tea.\u2018There\u2019s some cereal,\u2019 he said, pointing.He sounded shy again, though last night he\u2019d begun to talk quite freelyby the end of the evening, just as Rivers, caught between the roar of the fireand the roar of the sea, had started nodding off to sleep. \u2018I\u2019m sorry I had togo to bed so early,\u2019 Rivers said, reaching for the cereal packet.\u2018 \u2019S all right.\u2019 Visibly, he remembered what it was he was supposed toask next. \u2018Did you have a good night?\u2019\u2018Fine.\u2019 Rivers bit the reciprocal question back. He\u2019d heard part of Burns\u2019snight. Obviously, however hard Burns tried to thrust memories of the warbehind him, the nightmare followed.The doorbell rang, and Burns got up to answer it. \u2018This is Mrs Burril\u2019sday for sorting me out,\u2019 he said.Mrs Burril was a remarkably silent person, but she managed, withoutwords, to make it clear their presence was superfluous.Burns said, \u2018I thought we might go for a walk.\u2019The mist had thinned but not cleared. It moved in slow, cold currentsover the marshes, where drainage ditches and sump holes reflected a steelylight at the sky. Reeds whispered, with a noise like the palms of hands beingrubbed together. It was difficult to breathe, difficult even to move, and theyspoke in low voices when they spoke at all.They walked along a narrow raised path that divided the marshes fromthe river. Small yachts rode at anchor, the breeze just strong enough to maketheir rigging rattle, not a loud sound, but persistent and rather disturbing,like an irregular heart beat. Nothing else here could disturb. The estuary layflat and peaceful under a shrunken, silver sun, and nothing moved, exceptthe reeds, until a flight of ducks whistled past.Rivers had begun to realize how remarkable the area was. A strip of land,at times no more than a hundred yards wide, divided the estuary from theNorth Sea. Walking out along this strip, away from the town, into thebleached shingle distances, you became aware of two separate sounds: theroar and suck of waves on shingle, and the lulling sound of the river amongits reeds. If you moved to the left, the crunch and chop of boots on shinglecut out the gentler river sounds. If to the right, the tapping of rigging andthe lapping of water dominated, though you could still hear that the sea wasthere.They turned and looked back at the huddled town. \u2018You know, I love thisplace,\u2019 Burns said. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t like you to think I\u2019d left London just becauseof the raids. Actually it wasn\u2019t the raids, it was the regular meal-times. Youknow, everybody sitting down to eat. Waiting for food to be put in front ofthem. And father going on about the war. He\u2019s a great believer in the war,my father.\u2019\u2018Will they be coming to Suffolk at all?\u2019\u2018No, I shouldn\u2019t think so. They\u2019re both very busy in London.\u2019 Theyturned and walked on. \u2018It\u2019s best we don\u2019t see too much of each other at themoment. I am not a sight for sore eyes.\u2019A squat, circular building had begun to loom up out of the mist. It lookedrather like a Martello tower, Rivers thought, but he hadn\u2019t known they\u2019dbeen built as far north as this.\u2018This is the most northerly,\u2019 Burns said, slithering down the slope on tothe beach. Rivers followed him across the shingle and down into the dankhigh moat that surrounded the tower. In its shadow, all water sounds,whether hissing waves or lapping water, abruptly ceased. Ferns grew fromthe high walls of the moat; and the tower, where the lookout turret hadcrumbled away, was thronged with bindweed, but the overall impressionwas of a dead place.The sea must flood the moat at high tide, for all kinds of debris had beenwashed up and left. Driftwood, the torn-off wing of a gull, bits of blue andgreen glass. A child would have loved it, picking over these pieces.\u2018We used to play here,\u2019 Burns said. \u2018Daring each other, you know. Whocould go all the way up?\u2019There was a door, but it had planks nailed across it. Rivers peeredthrough a crack and saw stone steps going down.\u2018Strictly forbidden. They were always afraid we\u2019d get trapped in thecellars.\u2019\u2018I suppose they flood, don\u2019t they? At high tide?\u2019\u2018Yes. There\u2019s all kinds of stories told about it. People chained up and leftto drown. I think we rather liked that. We used to sit down there and pretendwe could see ghosts.\u2019\u2018It feels like a place where people have died. I mean, violent deaths.\u2019\u2018You feel that, do you? Yes. I expect that\u2019s why we liked it. Bloodthirstylittle horrors, boys.\u2019Rivers wasn\u2019t sorry when they climbed the bank of shingle and stood onthe beach in the strengthening sunlight again.\u2018Do you feel up to a longish walk?\u2019 Burns asked.\u2018Yes.\u2019\u2018All right. We can follow that path.\u2019They walked four or five miles inland, and came out into a wood wheregreat golden tongues of fungus lapped the trees, and a mulch of dead leavessquelched underfoot. Rather to Rivers\u2019s surprise they stopped at a pub onthe way back, though no food was available. Burns could drink apparently,and did, becoming in the process quite flushed and talkative, thoughnothing was said about his illness.They arrived back in the late afternoon with every bone and muscleaching. Mrs Burril had obviously built up the fire before she left, and it wasrescuable, just about. Rivers knelt in front of it, sticking strips of cerealpacket through the bars, and blowing when he got a flame. \u2018Have you anynewspapers?\u2019\u2018No,\u2019 Burns said.No, Rivers thought, silly question. Once the fire was burning well, Riverswent out and bought cakes and biscuits for tea, which he served in front ofthe fire, tucking in himself and not looking to see whether Burns ate or not.He ate, sitting on the hearth rug, his wind-reddened arms clasped about hisknees, and the firelight playing on his face.After the plates were cleared away, Rivers asked if he might work for acouple of hours. He was writing a paper on the Repression of WarExperience which he was due to give to the British Medical Association inDecember, and he knew, once he got back to Craiglockhart, there would bevery little time. He worked at the table in the window, with his back to theroom. He began by reading through what he\u2019d written so far on the evileffects that followed from patients trying to suppress their memories of warexperience, and was about to start writing when it occurred to him he was inthe same room as a man who was doing just that.Why do I go along with it? he thought. One answer, the easy answer, wasthat he was no longer Burns\u2019s doctor. It was up to Burns now how he choseto manage his illness. But then he\u2019d gone along with the suppression inCraiglockhart too. Whenever he\u2019d tried to apply to Burns the same methodsof treatment he used with everybody else, and used, for the most part,successfully, his nerve had failed him. He\u2019d told himself this was becauseof the peculiar nature of Burns\u2019s experience, the utter lack of any redeemingfeature the mind could grasp and hold on to while it steadied itself to facethe full horror. But was Burns\u2019s experience really worse than that of others?Worse than Jenkins\u2019s, crawling between the dismembered pieces of hisfriend\u2019s body to collect personal belongings to send back to the family?Worse than Prior\u2019s? What shall I do with this gob-stopper?Corpses were everywhere in the trenches. Used to strengthen parapets, toprop up sagging doorways, to fill in gaps in the duckboards. Many of hispatients treading on a dead body had been startled by the release of gas.Surely what had happened to Burns was merely an unusually disgustingversion of a common experience. And I\u2019ve let him, Rivers thought \u2013 no,that was unfair, that was completely unfair \u2013 I\u2019ve let myself turn it into \u2026some kind of myth. And that was unforgivable. He wasn\u2019t dealing withJonah in the belly of the whale, still less with Christ in the belly of theearth, he was dealing with David Burns, who\u2019d got his head stuck in thebelly of a dead German soldier, and somehow had to be helped to live withthe memory.He turned and looked at Burns, who was still sitting on the hearth rug,though now he\u2019d found himself a book and was reading, his tongueprotruding slightly between his teeth. As he felt Rivers\u2019s gaze, he looked upand smiled. Twenty-two. He should be worrying about the Tripos andscrewing up his courage to ask a girl to the May ball. And yet even nowRivers was nervous of raising the subject of his illness. Burns\u2019s instinctivereaction had been to get back to this house, to forget. And there had beensome improvement under this regime, by day at least, though evidently notby night. If he wants to talk, he\u2019ll talk, Rivers thought, and turned back tohis paper.That evening, rather to Rivers\u2019s surprise, they went to the pub. He wassurprised because he\u2019d been assuming Burns was isolated here, butapparently all the locals knew him. They\u2019d watched him growing up,summer by summer. The family had been staying here when war broke out.Burns had joined up along with most of the local lads. They all rememberedhim in his uniform, in the first days and weeks of the war, and perhaps thatmattered a great deal. In London, Burns said, on his first trip out in civilianclothes, he\u2019d been handed two white feathers.Here, as soon as they pushed the bar door open, he was hailed by severalpeople, and by one man in particular: \u2018Old Clegg\u2019. Clegg had rheumy blueeyes, whose overflow had dried to a scurfy crust at his temples; three brownbut very strong teeth; unidentifiable stains on his abdomen, and other stains,only too identifiable, further down. His conversation was so encrusted withsalty Suffolk sayings that Rivers suspected him of deliberate self-parody.That, or leg-pulling. Once he\u2019d discovered Rivers was interested in folklore,he was well away. Rivers spent a thoroughly enjoyable evening beinginitiated into the folklore of rural Suffolk. By closing time, he wasconvinced Clegg was possibly the most unreliable informant he\u2019d ever had.For sheer imaginative flights of fancy none of the Melanesians cameanywhere near him. \u2018That man is a complete fraud,\u2019 he said as they left thepub.But Burns disagreed. \u2018He\u2019s not a fraud, he\u2019s a rogue. Anyway as long ashe teaches me flint-knapping, I don\u2019t care.\u2019Next morning the weather had changed. At dawn there was a strip of clearblue on the horizon, fading to yellow, but the sky darkened rapidly, until, bymid morning, the clouds humped, liver-coloured, and the sea was dark asiron. The wind had risen during the night, sweeping away the last remnantsof mist. At first it came in little gusts, lifting the thin carpet in the hall,swirling dust in corners, then in blasts that made waves on the surface of theestuary, rocking the yachts until the rattle of their rigging became a frenzy,while on the beach great waves swelled like the muscles of an enormousanimal, rising to crests that hung and seethed along their full length, beforetoppling over in thunder and bursts of spray.Rivers worked on his paper all morning, looking up now and then to findthe window mizzled with rain. Burns slept late, having had another",

      "chapter_text": "the sounds of the alphabet, though, again, only \u2018ah\u2019 wasproduced and that in a hoarse whisper, very far back in the throat. Callanstumbled as he walked, and Yealland supported him. Up and down theywent, up and down, in and out of the circle of light around the battery.Rebellion came at last. Callan wrenched his arm out of Yealland\u2019s graspand ran to the door. Evidently he\u2019d forgotten it was locked, though heremembered at once and turned on Yealland.Yealland said, \u2018Such an idea as leaving me now is most ridiculous. Youcannot leave the room. The door is locked and the key is in my pocket. Youwill leave me when you are cured, remember, not before. I have no doubtyou are tired and discouraged, but that is not my fault; the reason is that youdo not understand your condition as I do, and the time you have alreadyspent with me is not long in comparison with the time I am prepared to staywith you. Do you understand me?\u2019Callan looked at Yealland. For a second the thought of striking him wasclearly visible, but then Callan seemed to admit defeat. He pointed to thebattery and then to his mouth, miming: Get on with it.\u2018No,\u2019 Yealland said. \u2018The time for more electrical treatment has not yetcome; if it had, I should give it to you. Suggestions are not wanted fromyou; they are not needed. When the time comes for more electricity, youwill be given it whether you want it or not.\u2019 He paused. Then added withgreat emphasis: \u2018You must speak, but I shall not listen to anything you haveto say.\u2019They walked up and down again, Callan still repeating \u2018ah\u2019, but makingno other sound. The \u2018ah\u2019 was produced by an almost superhuman effort, themuscles of the neck in spasm, the head raised in a series of jerks. Even thetorso and the arms were involved in the immense effort of pushing thissound across his lips. Rivers had to stop himself trying to make the soundfor him. He was himself very tense; all the worst memories of his stammercame crowding into his mind.Yealland said, \u2018You are now ready for the next stage of treatment, whichconsists of the administration of strong shocks to the outside of the neck.These will be transmitted to your voice box and you will soon be able to sayanything you like in a whisper.\u2019Callan was again placed in the chair and again strapped in. The keyelectrode was applied in short bursts to his neck in the region of the larynx,Yealland repeating \u2018ah, bah, cah, dah\u2019, etc. in time with the shocks. On thethird repetition of the alphabet, Callan suddenly said \u2018ba\u2019. Instead ofattempting the next sound, he went on repeating \u2018ba\u2019, not loudly, butvenomously. \u2018Bah, bah\u2019, and then, unmistakably \u2018Baaaa! Baaaaa! Baaaaaa!\u2019Yealland actually looked gratified. He said, \u2018Are you not glad you havemade such progress?\u2019Callan started to cry. For a while there was no other sound in the roomthan his sobbing. Then he wiped his eyes on the back of his hand andmimed a request for water.\u2018Yes, you will have water soon. Just as soon as you can utter a word.\u2019Callan pushed Yealland aside and ran to the door, rattling the handle,beating on the wood with his clenched fists. Rivers couldn\u2019t bear to go onwatching. He looked down at the backs of his clasped hands.Yealland said, \u2018You will leave this room when you are speaking normally.I know you do not want the treatment suspended now you are making suchprogress. You are a noble fellow and these ideas which come into yourmind and make you want to leave me do not represent your true self. Iknow you are anxious to be cured and are happy to have recovered to suchan extent; now you are tired and cannot think properly, but you must makeevery effort to think in the manner characteristic of your true self: a hero ofMons.\u2019Perhaps Callan remembered, as Yealland apparently did not, that Monshad been a defeat. At any rate he went back to the chair.\u2018You must utter a sound,\u2019 Yealland said. \u2018I do not care what the nature ofthe sound is. You will understand me when I say I shall be able to train anysound into the production of vowel sounds, then into letter sounds, andfinally into words and sentences. Utter a sound when you take a deepbreath, and as soon as I touch your throat.\u2019Callan, although he appeared to be co-operating, could make noexpiratory sound.Yealland appeared to lose patience. He clamped his hands down on toCallan\u2019s wrists and said, \u2018This has gone on long enough. I may have to usea stronger current. I do not want to hurt you, but if necessary I must.\u2019Rivers couldn\u2019t tell whether the anger was acted or real, but there was nodoubt about the strength of the current being applied to the neck in shockafter shock. But it worked. Soon Callan was repeating \u2018ah\u2019 at a normalpitch, then other sounds, then words. At this point Yealland stopped the useof electricity, and Callan sagged forward in the chair. He looked as if hewere going to fall, but the straps held him in place. \u2018Go on repeating thedays,\u2019 Yealland said.\u2018S-s-s-sunday. M-m-m-m-m-monday. T-t-t-t-Tuesday \u2026\u2019Saturday came at last.Yealland said, \u2018Remember there is no way out, except by the return ofyour proper voice and by that door. I have one key, you have the other.When you can talk properly, I shall open the door and you can go back tothe ward.\u2019And so it went on, through the alphabet, the days of the week, the monthsof the year \u2013 the shocks sometimes mild, sometimes extremely strong \u2013until he was speaking normally. As soon as he could say words clearly at anormal pitch, he developed a spasm or tremor \u2013 not unlike paralysis agitans\u2013 in his left arm. Yealland applied a roller electrode to the arm. The tremorthen reappeared in the right arm, then the left leg, and finally the right leg,each appearance being treated with the application of the electrode. Finallythe cure was pronounced complete. Callan was permitted to stand up. \u2018Areyou not pleased to be cured?\u2019 Yealland asked.Callan smiled.\u2018I do not like your smile,\u2019 Yealland said. \u2018I find it most objectionable. Sitdown.\u2019Callan sat.\u2018This will not take a moment,\u2019 Yealland said. \u2018Smile.\u2019Callan smiled and the key electrode was applied to the side of his mouth.When he was finally permitted to stand up again, he no longer smiled.\u2018Are you not pleased to be cured?\u2019 Yealland repeated.\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\u2018Nothing else?\u2019A fractional hesitation. Then Callan realized what was required and camesmartly to the salute. \u2018Thank you, sir.\u2019TWENTY-TWOThat evening after dinner Rivers tried to work on a paper he was due to giveto the Royal Society of Medicine in December. As he read through whathe\u2019d written, he became aware that he was being haunted by images. Theman in the corridor at Queen Square, Yealland\u2019s hands, Callan\u2019s openmouth, the two figures, doctor and patient, walking up and down, in and outof the circle of light round the battery. It was unusual for Rivers to visualizeas intensely as this, indeed to visualize at all, but then the whole experience,from beginning to end, had had something \u2026 hallucinatory about it.Rivers left the typewriter and went to sit in his armchair by the fire. Assoon as he abandoned the attempt to concentrate on the paper, he knew hewas ill. He was sweating, his heart pounded, pulses all over his bodythrobbed, and he felt again that extraordinary sensation of blood squeezingthrough his veins. He thought he might have a slight temperature, but henever, as a matter of principle, took his own temperature or measured hispulse. There were depths of neuroticism to which he was not prepared tosink.His confrontation with Yealland had exhausted him, for, however politethey had each been to each other, it had been a confrontation. He was tootired to go on working, but he knew if he went to bed in this state hewouldn\u2019t sleep, even if there was no disturbance from the guns. He decidedto take a turn on the Heath, fetched his greatcoat from the peg and creptdownstairs. Mrs Irving was a pleasant enough woman, but she was also avery lonely woman, and inclined to air her grievances about the excessivedemands of Belgian refugees. He reached the bottom of the stairs, listened amoment, then quietly let himself out of the house.He felt his way along the dark street. Shuttered windows, like blind eyes,watched from either side. It was something new this darkness, like the deepdarkness of the countryside. Even on the Heath, where normally Londonwas spread out before you in a blaze of light, there was only darkness, andagain darkness. Starlight lay on the pond, waking a dull gleam, like metal.Nothing else. He started to walk round the edge, trying to empty his mindof Queen Square, but the images floated before him like specks in the eye.Again and again he saw Callan\u2019s face, heard his voice repeating simplewords, a grotesque parody of Adam naming created things. He felt pursued.There they were, the two of them, Yealland and his patient, walking up anddown inside his head. Uninvited. If this was what habitual visualizersexperienced, he could only say he found it most unpleasant.He stopped and looked at the pond. He was aware of rustling, draggingfootsteps. Somebody bumped into him and muttered something, but hemoved away. By the time he got back to his lodgings he felt much better,well enough to greet Mrs Irving in the hall and compliment her on a morethan adequate dinner.Back in his own rooms he went straight to bed. The sheets felt cold, socold he again wondered if he was running a temperature, but at least thepalpitations and the breathlessness had gone. He thought he might manageto sleep if the Zeppelins and the guns allowed it, and indeed he did fallasleep almost as soon as he turned off the light.He was walking down the corridor at Queen Square, an immensely longcorridor which elongated as he walked along it, like a strip of elastic at fullstretch. The swing doors at the far end opened and shut, flap-flapping anunnaturally long time, like the wings of an ominous bird. Clinging to therail, the deformed man watched him approach. The eyes swivelled to followhim. The mouth opened and out of it came the words: I am making thisprotest on behalf of my fellow-soldiers because I believe the war is beingdeliberately prolonged by those who have the power to end it.The words echoed along the white corridor. Abruptly the dream changed.He was in the electrical room, a pharyngeal electrode in his hand, a man\u2019sopen mouth in front of him. He saw the moist, pink interior, the delicatelyquivering uvula, the yellowish, grainy surface of the tongue, and the tonsils,like great swollen, blue-purple eggs. He slipped the tongue depressor in,and tried to apply the electrode, but the electrode, for some reason,wouldn\u2019t fit. He tried to force it. The man struggled and bucked beneathhim, and, looking down, he saw that the object he was holding was ahorse\u2019s bit. He\u2019d already done a lot of damage. The corners of the man\u2019smouth were raw, flecked with blood and foam, but still he went on, trying toforce the bit into the mouth, until a cry from the patient woke him. He satup, heart pounding, and realized he had himself cried out. For a second thedream was so real that he went on seeing the chair, the battery, the torturedmouth. Then, nothing. Gradually, his heart beat returned to normal, thoughwhen he got out of bed and went across to sit by the window the smalleffort made it pound again.No raid tonight. It was ironic that on this one quiet night he should havewoken himself up with a nightmare. As with all nightmares, the horrorlingered. He was still inclined to accuse himself. That, he thought \u2013 self-reproach \u2013 had been the dominant affect. At first he was inclined to connectit with the quasi-sexual imagery of the dream, for the dream action hadbeen both an accurate representation of Yealland\u2019s treatment anduncomfortably like an oral rape. He didn\u2019t feel, however, that theunderlying conflict had been sexual.The manifest content came from his visit to Queen Square, and waspresent with relatively little transformation. There was no doubt that thevisit had been rife with opportunities for conflict. From the beginning he\u2019dfelt a tension between, on the one hand, his sympathy for the patients, hisdoubts about the quality of the treatment they were receiving, and on theother, the social and professional demands on him to be reasonably polite.As the day had gone on, this conflict had certainly deepened. Over lunchYealland had told him about an officer patient of his who stammered badly,and whom Yealland had cured in \u2013 as usual \u2013 one session. Rivers \u2013 to hisown amusement and exasperation \u2013 had responded to the story bybeginning to stammer rather badly. And whenever he\u2019d hesitated over aword, he\u2019d sensed Yealland calculating the voltage. All nonsense of course.He\u2019d been more amused by the situation than anything else, butnevertheless the worsening of his stammer did point to an underlyingconflict that might well find expression in a dream.The man in the corridor with the spinal contracture seemed to representSassoon, since he\u2019d quoted the Declaration, though it was difficult toimagine anybody more physically unlike Sassoon than that deformed,pseudo-dwarf. And the expression of antagonism \u2013 that certainly didn\u2019tcorrespond with anything in the real Sassoon\u2019s attitude towards him. Butthen there was no reason why it should. The dream action is the creation ofthe dreamer. The mood of this dream, a mood so powerful he could still notshake it off, was one of the most painful self-accusation. The man\u2019sexpression need reflect no more than his feeling that Sassoon, perhaps, hadgrounds for antagonism.He hadn\u2019t been able to see the face of the second patient, and had noclear sense of who it was. The obvious candidate was Callan, since it wasCallan he\u2019d watched being treated. And Callan had been working withhorses when he became mute, which might account for the bit. And yet hewas fairly certain the dream patient had not been Callan.On the wards he\u2019d been struck by a slight facial resemblance betweenCallan and Prior, who had also been mute when he arrived at Craiglockhart.He remembered an incident shortly after Prior\u2019s arrival when he\u2019d draggeda teaspoon across the back of his throat, hoping that the choking reflexwould trigger the return of speech. This did sometimes happen. He\u2019d seenmore than one patient recover his voice in that way. But he\u2019d tried it whilein a state of acute irritation with Prior, and the choking had occasioned amomentary spasm of satisfaction. Very slight, but enough to make him feel,in retrospect, discontented with his own behaviour. Mute patients did arouseexasperation, particularly, as with both Prior and Callan, when theirsatisfaction with their condition was hardly at all disguised. Perhaps thedream patient was a composite figure, part Callan, part Prior, thecombination suggested by his application of a teaspoon to Prior\u2019s throat andYealland\u2019s application of an electrode to Callan\u2019s.But there was no comparison in the amount of pain inflicted. On the faceof it he seemed to be congratulating himself on dealing with patients morehumanely than Yealland, but then why the mood of self-accusation? In thedream he stood in Yealland\u2019s place. The dream seemed to be saying, indream language, don\u2019t flatter yourself. There is no distinction.A horse\u2019s bit. Not an electrode, not a teaspoon. A bit. An instrument ofcontrol. Obviously he and Yealland were both in the business of controllingpeople. Each of them fitted young men back into the role of warrior, a rolethey had \u2013 however unconsciously \u2013 rejected. He\u2019d found himselfwondering once or twice recently what possible meaning the restoration ofmental health could have in relation to his work. Normally a cure impliesthat the patient will no longer engage in behaviour that is clearly self-destructive. But in present circumstances, recovery meant the resumption ofactivities that were not merely self-destructive but positively suicidal. Butthen in a war nobody is a free agent. He and Yealland were both locked in,every bit as much as their patients were.Bits. The scold\u2019s bridle used to silence recalcitrant women in the MiddleAges. More recently, on American slaves. And yet on the ward, listening tothe list of Callan\u2019s battles, he\u2019d felt that nothing Callan could say couldhave been more powerful than his silence. Later, in the electrical room, asCallan began slowly to repeat the alphabet, walking up and down withYealland, in and out of the circle of light, Rivers had felt that he waswitnessing the silencing of a human being. Indeed, Yealland had come veryclose to saying just that. \u2018You must speak, but I shall not listen to anythingyou have to say.\u2019Silencing, then. The task of silencing somebody, with himself inYealland\u2019s place and an unidentified patient in the chair. It was possible toescape still, to pretend the dream accusation was general. Just as Yeallandsilenced the unconscious protest of his patients by removing the paralysis,the deafness, the blindness, the muteness that stood between them and thewar, so, in an infinitely more gentle way, he silenced his patients; for thestammerings, the nightmares, the tremors, the memory lapses, of officerswere just as much unwitting protest as the grosser maladies of the men.But he didn\u2019t believe in the general accusation. He didn\u2019t believe this waswhat the dream was saying. Dreams were detailed, concrete, specific: thevoice of the protopathic heard at last, as one by one the higher centres of thebrain closed down. And he knew who the patient in the chair was. NotCallan, not Prior. Only one man was being silenced in the way the dreamindicated. He told himself that the accusation was unjust. It was Sassoon\u2019sdecision to abandon the protest, not his. But that didn\u2019t work. He knew theextent of his own influence.He went on sitting by the window as dawn grew over the Heath, and feltthat he was having to appeal against conviction in a courtroom where hehimself had been both judge and jury.TWENTY-THREEHead\u2019s room was very quiet. The tall windows that overlooked the squarewere shrouded in white net. Outside was a day of moving clouds and fitfulsunlight, and whenever the sun shone, the naked branches of plane treespatterned the floor. So Head\u2019s patients must sit, hour after hour, with thosebright, rather prominent eyes fixed on them, while elsewhere in the housedoors banged and a telephone started to ring. But there the normality of the\u2018consultation\u2019 ended, for Head would never, not even under the mostextreme provocation, have told a patient that he was talking a load of self-indulgent rubbish. Rivers opened his mouth to protest and was waved intosilence.\u2018All right,\u2019 Head swept on. \u2018He\u2019s muddle-headed, immature, liable to fitsof enthusiasm, inconsistent. All of that. But \u2026 And he virtually had nofather and he\u2019s put you in his father\u2019s place. But, he\u2019s also\u2019 \u2013 ticking off onhis fingers \u2013 \u2018brave, capable of resisting any amount of pressure \u2013 the merefact he protested at all in the present climate tells us that \u2013 and above all \u2013no, let me finish \u2013 he has integrity. Everything you\u2019ve told me about himsuggests he was always going to go back, as soon as he knew the protestwas useless, simply because there\u2019s no way he can honourably stay inCraiglockhart taking up a bed he doesn\u2019t need.\u2019Rivers smiled. \u2018What are friends for if not letting you off the hook?\u2019\u2018Well, let me get you off the other hook while I\u2019m about it. You andYealland doing essentially the same thing. Good God, man, if you reallybelieve that it\u2019s the first sign of dementia. I can\u2019t imagine anybody less likeYealland \u2013 methods, attitudes, values \u2013 everything. The whole attitude tothe patient. And in spite of all this self-laceration, I can\u2019t help thinking youknow that. Who would you rather be sent to if you were the patient?\u2019\u2018You.\u2019Head smiled.",
