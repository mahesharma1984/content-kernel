# Archive: December 2025 Pipeline Exploration

## What's Here
- Staged content pipeline (Stages 1-5)
- KDD methodology experiments
- Old generate_static_site.py (flat URL structure)
- render_html_v1_0.py, generate_html_v1_0.py
- Partial dist/ with Orbital + Regeneration pages

## Why Archived
- Content creation overcomplicated
- Site infrastructure needs rebuild for new directory structure
- Manual content workflow replacing automated pipeline

## Potentially Reusable
- Tailwind styling approach in dist/ pages
- SEO meta tag patterns
- _headers file for Netlify

## Not Reusable
- Sitemap generator (wrong URL structure)
- Homepage generator (wrong URL structure)
- Content pipeline scripts (replaced by manual + REWRITING_METHOD)
