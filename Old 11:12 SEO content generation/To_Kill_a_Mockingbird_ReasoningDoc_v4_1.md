## 3. Device Selections by Freytag Section

**Exposition**: Foreshadowing, Flashback, Personification, Simile — establish Scout's retrospective voice and hint at coming conflicts while creating vivid sense of place through childlike observations.

**Rising Action**: Situational Irony, Dialogue, Imagery — develop moral tensions through Scout's growing awareness of adult contradictions, authentic character voices, and sensory details that ground abstract concepts.

**Climax**: Symbolism, Juxtaposition, Rhetorical Question, Repetition — intensify the trial's significance through symbolic mockingbird imagery, contrast between justice ideals and reality, questioning of moral assumptions, and repeated emphasis on key themes.

**Falling Action**: Dramatic Irony, Verbal Irony, Metaphor — pivot toward resolution as readers understand more than Scout about Boo's protection, adult speech reveals deeper meanings, and metaphorical language deepens thematic resonance.

**Resolution**: First-Person Narration — complete the pattern by fully utilizing Scout's mature retrospective voice to synthesize childhood experience into adult wisdom about empathy and understanding.

## 4. Alignment Effect

This Nostalgic Instruction pattern achieves a powerful dual effect: the FP-INT-RETRO narrative voice creates intimate access to authentic childhood experience, while the ADV stance and TIGHT N-R relationship ensure that Scout's personal story becomes a vehicle for broader moral instruction about racial injustice and human empathy. The ACCUMULATION mediation through CHAR mechanism builds understanding gradually—Atticus embodies moral courage while Tom represents innocent victimhood—supported by devices that move from establishing childhood wonder (Personification, Simile) through revealing adult hypocrisy (Situational Irony, Dramatic Irony) to synthesizing mature insight (First-Person Narration). The STRONG pathos combined with SIT irony allows readers to feel both the warmth of childhood memory and the sting of social critique, creating lasting emotional and intellectual impact that transforms personal narrative into universal moral guidance.
