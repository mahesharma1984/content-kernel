## 4. Alignment Effect

This Investigative Fatalism alignment creates a unique reader experience where TPL focalization and RETRO distance combine with FRAG chronology to mirror the detective's methodology while OBJ stance and SIT irony reveal the futility of the investigation. The HEAVY intrusion and THEME mechanism ensure that every device—from the opening Imagery through the climactic Paradox to the resolving Imagery—serves both the narrative reconstruction and the rhetorical exploration of fate versus responsibility. The TIGHT N-R relationship and JUXTAPOSITION mediation create a text that functions simultaneously as mystery and meditation, where TRANS alignment allows the investigation to transform into acceptance. Readers experience the narrator's journey from seeking answers to accepting mystery, with VAR pacing and CIRCULAR structure emphasizing that some truths resist explanation, making the very act of investigation both necessary and ultimately insufficient.
