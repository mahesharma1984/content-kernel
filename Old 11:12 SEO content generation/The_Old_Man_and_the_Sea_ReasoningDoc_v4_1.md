## 4. Alignment Effect

This Stoic Retrospection pattern achieves profound emotional impact through restraint rather than amplification. The TPL + INT narrative access allows readers intimate connection with Santiago's consciousness while OBJ stance and elegiac tone prevent sentimentality from undermining his dignity. The ANA chronology and RETRO distance create space for contemplation, while REPETITION and sparse device density mirror Santiago's own understated heroism. Devices like Imagery and Symbolism work through suggestion rather than explicit statement, honoring the "iceberg theory" where deeper meaning emerges from what remains unspoken. The result is a reading experience that respects both the character's nobility and the reader's intelligence, creating lasting resonance through disciplined artistic restraint.
