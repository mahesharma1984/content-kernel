## 4. Alignment Effect

The Clinical Immersion pattern achieves profound psychological realism by combining TPL and INT access with OBJ stance and FORM register, creating intimate yet analytically precise examination of war trauma. The BRAID architecture supports this by weaving multiple therapeutic relationships through ACCUMULATION mediation, allowing readers to experience both empathetic connection and clinical understanding. Devices like Flashback and Motif execute the pattern by revealing psychological depth, while Dramatic Irony and Situational Irony maintain the clinical detachment necessary for examining sensitive material. This alignment produces a reading experience that functions as both literary narrative and psychological case study, enabling readers to understand trauma's complexity without exploiting victims' suffering.
