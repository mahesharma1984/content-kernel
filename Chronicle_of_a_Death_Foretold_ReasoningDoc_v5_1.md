## 1. Alignment Pattern

**Pattern**: Investigative Fatalism

**Core Dynamic**: First-person retrospective investigation combines with objective fatalistic stance to create journalistic distance from predetermined tragedy.

**Reader Effect**: The reader experiences the inevitability of fate through methodical reconstruction, where knowing the outcome intensifies rather than diminishes dramatic tension.

## 2. Macro Variable Justifications

**Narrative Voice**: The FP (first-person) POV establishes the investigative framework, with the narrator collecting testimonies twenty-seven years after Santiago Nasar's murder. EXT (external) focalization maintains journalistic objectivity—the narrator reports what witnesses told him without accessing inner thoughts directly. REL (reliable) narrator provides credible testimony reconstruction, while RETRO (retrospective) temporal distance creates the archaeological quality of uncovering buried truth. SOME intrusion allows the narrator to editorialize subtly about fate and collective responsibility.

**Narrative Structure**: FRAG (fragmented) chronology mirrors the investigative process—testimonies arrive in fragments that must be pieced together. MONO (monolithic) architecture focuses entirely on this single murder investigation. SLOW pacing reflects methodical reconstruction and the weight of inevitability. MEDIAS (in medias res) beginning—opening with Santiago's death foretold—immediately establishes the fatalistic stance that the outcome is known.

**Rhetorical Voice**: OBJ (objective) stance creates journalistic distance essential to the investigative approach. The fatalistic, melancholic, journalistic yet poetic tone balances reportorial objectivity with literary artistry. POET (poetic) register elevates the investigation beyond mere journalism into mythic territory. SIT (situational) irony permeates the text—everyone knows Santiago will die, yet no one prevents it.

**Rhetorical Structure**: TRANS (transformational) alignment as the investigation gradually reveals how collective inaction enabled the tragedy. TIGHT N-R relationship ensures narrative techniques serve the thematic investigation. THEME mechanism drives the exploration of fate versus free will. REPETITION mediation reinforces the cyclical, inescapable nature of the tragedy.

## 3. Device Selections by Freytag Section

**Exposition**: Foreshadowing, First-Person Narration, Dramatic Irony, Juxtaposition, Repetition, Dialogue, Imagery, and Symbolism establish the investigative framework. The opening line "On the day they were going to kill him, Santiago Nasar got up at five-thirty in the morning" immediately demonstrates how Foreshadowing and Dramatic Irony create the fatalistic atmosphere. First-Person Narration positions the reader as fellow investigator, while Dialogue presents witness testimonies that will be central to the reconstruction.

**Rising Action**: Foreshadowing, Dialogue, Repetition, Juxtaposition, Dramatic Irony, First-Person Narration, Imagery, and Situational Irony develop the investigative methodology. Repetition of details across different testimonies highlights both consistency and contradiction in memory. Juxtaposition of past and present, different accounts, and varying perspectives creates the fragmented reconstruction effect. Dialogue continues to serve as primary evidence.

**Climax**: Imagery, Symbolism, First-Person Narration, Repetition, Dramatic Irony, Juxtaposition, Motif, and Situational Irony intensify the fatalistic atmosphere. The murder scene relies heavily on visceral Imagery while Symbolism (doors, weather, dreams) reaches maximum density. Repetition of "fatal" details creates inevitability's crescendo. Motif patterns culminate as all symbolic threads converge.

**Falling Action**: First-Person Narration, Imagery, Juxtaposition, Dialogue, Repetition, Dramatic Irony, Symbolism, and Situational Irony pivot toward aftermath analysis. The investigative stance shifts from reconstruction to interpretation. Juxtaposition of what could have been versus what was emphasizes the tragedy's preventable yet inevitable nature. Dialogue provides post-mortem testimonies about collective guilt.

**Resolution**: First-Person Narration, Imagery, Dialogue, Juxtaposition, Dramatic Irony, Repetition, Symbolism, and Situational Irony complete the investigative circle. The narrator's final assessment maintains objectivity while acknowledging the mystery's fundamental irresolution. Repetition of key phrases and images creates closure while Dramatic Irony ensures the reader understands that some truths about fate and responsibility remain unknowable.

## 4. Alignment Effect

This alignment achieves a unique literary effect where investigative methodology serves existential inquiry rather than mere plot resolution. The combination of FP retrospective narration with OBJ stance and FRAG chronology creates a documentary-style reconstruction that paradoxically heightens rather than diminishes dramatic tension—because readers know Santiago dies, attention shifts to how collective inaction enables tragedy. The TRANS rhetorical alignment allows the investigation to transform from criminal inquiry into meditation on fate, honor, and social responsibility. Devices like Repetition and Dramatic Irony reinforce the fatalistic atmosphere while Dialogue and First-Person Narration maintain investigative credibility. The result is a text that functions simultaneously as mystery novel and philosophical treatise, where THEME-driven organization and REPETITION mediation create the hypnotic, inevitable rhythm of destiny fulfilling itself despite—or because of—everyone's foreknowledge.
