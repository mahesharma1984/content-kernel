## 1. Alignment Pattern

**Pattern**: Passionate Retrospection

**Core Dynamic**: First-person retrospective narration (FP + RETRO) channels subjective moral passion (SUBJ + passionate tone) through controlled literary form to transform personal experience into universal moral instruction.

**Reader Effect**: This creates intimate access to Jane's consciousness while maintaining analytical distance, allowing readers to experience her emotional journey as both lived experience and moral exemplum.

## 2. Macro Variable Justifications

**Narrative Voice**: FP + INT creates direct access to Jane's consciousness as she tells her own story, while REL establishes her as trustworthy despite her passionate nature. RETRO provides the temporal distance necessary for moral reflection, and SOME intrusion allows for direct address to readers about moral lessons.

**Narrative Structure**: LIN chronology follows Jane's bildungsroman journey from childhood to adulthood. MONO architecture maintains focus on her singular development. VAR pacing alternates between detailed psychological analysis and rapid plot advancement. AB_OVO beginning establishes her disadvantaged origins as crucial context. CLOSED ending provides moral resolution through marriage and equality.

**Rhetorical Voice**: SUBJ stance validates personal experience as moral authority. The passionate yet controlled tone balances emotional authenticity with moral restraint. FORM register elevates the narrative above mere autobiography. SIT irony exposes social hypocrisies through Jane's perspective.

**Rhetorical Structure**: TRANS alignment uses Jane's personal transformation to argue for social reform. TIGHT N-R relationship ensures every narrative detail serves the rhetorical purpose of demonstrating equality and moral independence. CHAR mechanism makes Jane's character development the primary argument for social change. ACCUMULATION builds evidence through repeated instances of moral courage.

## 3. Device Selections by Freytag Section

**Exposition**: No specific devices listed — the FP + RETRO combination establishes the pattern of retrospective moral analysis from the opening at Gateshead.

**Rising Action**: Foreshadowing, Metaphor, Situational Irony, and Imagery develop the pattern by building symbolic meaning around Jane's moral development. These devices transform plot events into moral instruction through Jane's retrospective understanding.

**Climax**: Personification, Symbolism, Juxtaposition, Simile, and Hyperbole intensify the pattern by heightening the moral stakes of Jane's choice between passion and principle. The concentration of devices reflects the intensity of moral crisis.

**Falling Action**: Dramatic Irony, Verbal Irony, and Parallelism pivot the pattern by revealing the consequences of moral choices. Jane's retrospective knowledge creates ironic distance from her past naivety while parallel structures emphasize moral growth.

**Resolution**: First-Person Narration completes the pattern by returning full focus to Jane's direct testimony, now validated by her moral journey and achieved equality.

## 4. Alignment Effect

This alignment achieves a revolutionary rhetorical purpose: transforming the Bildungsroman form into social advocacy. The combination of FP + INT + RETRO with SUBJ + passionate tone creates unprecedented narrative authority for a female protagonist, while FORM register and SIT irony legitimize her critiques of social hierarchy. The TRANS alignment uses CHAR mechanism to argue that personal moral development can challenge social structures, while ACCUMULATION of moral victories builds toward the CLOSED resolution where equality is achieved. The VAR pacing and concentrated device deployment in the climax emphasize moments of moral choice, making Jane's retrospective FP narration not merely personal confession but moral instruction. This synthesis of intimate access with analytical distance allows Brontë to use Jane's individual story as universal argument for women's moral and social equality.
