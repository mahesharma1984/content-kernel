  "agitation_register": "You know TKAM feels different from other memory books - but you can't put your finger on why",
  "solution_register": "The Maturing Moral Witness pattern creates unique dual consciousness through retrospective narration that filters adult moral understanding through childhood innocence, creating simultaneous wonder and judgment",
  "selection_rationale": "Scores highest (35/40) because it perfectly balances all four criteria. It's anchored in a relatable feeling everyone has but can't explain, making it memorable without being academic. It's completely differentiating - no other TKAM analysis compares it to memory narratives or promises to reveal 'the exact pattern.' It's maximally pattern-anchored because the entire message is meaningless without understanding the Maturing Moral Witness pattern - you literally cannot deliver on 'the exact pattern that creates dual consciousness' without the kernel. And it has perfect funnel continuity: the agitation register hooks with the mysterious 'different feeling,' the solution register delivers the complete structural explanation.",
  "kernel_pattern_reference": "This thread IS the kernel's reader effect made concrete. The 'different feeling' is exactly the dual consciousness the pattern creates. The message promises to reveal the structural mechanism behind this effect.",
