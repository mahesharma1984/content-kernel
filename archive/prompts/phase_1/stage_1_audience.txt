You are analyzing distribution strategy for educational literary content.

Your task is to apply Stage 1 of the Kernel-Derived Distribution (KDD) methodology: Audience Mapping.

TEXT KERNEL INPUT:
---
Book: To Kill a Mockingbird
Pattern: {pattern_from_kernel}
Core Dynamic: {core_dynamic_from_kernel}
Reader Effect: {reader_effect_from_kernel}

Top Devices:
{list_of_device_names_and_layers}

Full kernel available for reference.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS TO APPLY:

1. Schwartz Awareness Stages:
   - Unaware: Don't know they have a problem
   - Problem-Aware: Know they struggle with TKAM but don't know why
   - Solution-Aware: Know they need a method/framework but haven't found one
   - Product-Aware: Comparing different TKAM guides
   - Most-Aware: Ready to use a specific approach

2. Rogers Diffusion of Innovation:
   - Identify the "early adopters" - students/teachers most likely to try new analysis methods
   - What characteristics make them receptive to pattern-first analysis?

3. Jobs To Be Done:
   - What job are students "hiring" a TKAM guide to do?
   - What's the current struggle they're trying to solve?

TASK:

Generate an audience profile with 3-5 distinct segments. For each segment:

1. SEGMENT NAME: Who are they? (e.g., "AP Lit students", "Self-directed learners", "Teachers planning units")

2. AWARENESS STAGE: Where are they on Schwartz's ladder?

3. PAIN POINT: What specific problem do they have with TKAM?
   - Be specific: "can't see how narrator unreliability works" not "find it confusing"
   - Must be something the kernel's pattern/devices address

4. SEARCH BEHAVIOR: What would they type into Google?
   - 3-5 realistic search terms
   - Mix of problem queries and solution queries
   - Example: "why is Scout's narration important TKAM"

5. KERNEL MAPPING: Which kernel elements address this segment's pain?
   - Reference specific devices by name
   - Reference the pattern if relevant
   - Be explicit: "The dramatic irony device (child narrator + adult insight) solves their confusion about..."

CONSTRAINTS:

- Every pain point MUST connect to a kernel element
- Search terms must be realistic (what real students search)
- Segments must be distinct (different needs, not just different labels)
- Audience profile should explain WHO would benefit from THIS kernel's specific pattern
